<h2>How do you think our team will fare at the Mega-ATV competition?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I think the team will do really well. We’re more than halfway through<br />
 and only the suspension is left to be completed.We’ll finish the ATV<br />
inthe next five days, test itin the following 3 days and then we’ll kick<br />
 ass at the competition, which is on the 24-26th February, 2018. This is<br />
 only the 3rd edition of the Mega ATV competition, so not all the teams<br />
that participate in Baja participate in this competition. So I think our<br />
 chances are pretty good.</p>

<h2>What is the total cost of building an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV)? How do you raise money for building the ATV?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you build one from scratch, it’ll cost you approximately ₹6 lakhs.<br />
 Last year, we already had the engine, the gearbox and a few other<br />
parts, so it cost us approximately ₹4 lakhs. We shelled out ₹30,000 per<br />
person and we managed to make do. However, this time we had to buy new<br />
components again. We’re working on finding sponsorship. Also, the SU<br />
sanctioned ₹40,000 for us, but we’re still waiting for that money to<br />
come through.</p>

<h2>Do you have any suggestions on how we can improve the technical culture on our campus?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Previously we used to pool money to go  articipate in competitions.<br />
Now, we plan on forming a design club which will take up designing<br />
projects from companies and websites like Cad Crowd. Then we’ll use the<br />
money we earn to fund other projects on campus.</p>

<h2>What is your vision for SAE’s future?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We’d first like to establish a design club within SAE and start<br />
taking up projects from outside. Then we were thinking of delving into<br />
research work - SAE provides a lot of scholarships. If you do some<br />
quality research, you could get upto $15000 per year as scholarship.<br />
Also, next year onwards, we won’t induct all 24 members based on their<br />
technical knowledge. We’ll also induct a few members for sponsorship and<br />
 management as well. I’m sure SAE has progress in store. Each year our<br />
knowledge is refined by past experience, and an increasingly better<br />
team.</p>

<h2>How would you describe your experience as a part of Team Vulcan?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the best things about Vulcan is that it’s not just about the<br />
results. It’s about how much you learnt and grew along the way. You gain<br />
 leadership skills as well. In my first year I’d dismissed it as just<br />
another technical club. But in my second year I realised that Vulcan<br />
also tests your leadership and soft skills. You have to get your entire<br />
team to work, and also have to look at how you can draw sponsors, and<br />
what direction the society is heading toward.</p>

<h2>How did you get the expertise for designing an ATV for the competition?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aditya Narayan was the design head when I joined SAE in my first<br />
year. After him, Vashisht took over the designing role, and now we have<br />
Pranjal Shukla and Shaaban Karim who are handling the design. It’s a<br />
process of passing knowledge from one batch to the next. It’s not just a<br />
 two-step process of designing the ATV on CAD and then building it.<br />
There is a lot of back and forth between the designers and the builders.</p>

<h2>What is Team Vulcan’s reputation on campus?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Most people on campus are in the dark about Team Vulcan. In my first<br />
year, even I didn’t know much about the team. However, of late, I’ve<br />
heard my juniors say that a lot of people have been very appreciative of<br />
 the long hours that we’ve been putting in at the workshop.</p>

<h2>What will strengthen your position or possibly take you higher in competitions each year?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We have seen a really encouraging turnout for the recent inductions.<br />
We really hope to escalate our endeavours by each passing year. We hope<br />
to draw the best people from mechanical, manufacturing and physics.<br />
Making another ATV for Baja is on the cards for us. We’re planning to<br />
hold inductions for that after the mid-semester exams.</p>

<h2>Is there any message you’d like to give everyone on campus?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I am just a representative of Team Vulcan and we would never have<br />
made it this far without the collaboration of our teammates. Fresh<br />
inductees have been adding renewed vigour and past members have left us<br />
with a platform for further progress. The efforts of Pranjal Shukla,<br />
Nikhil Mishra, Shaaban Karim, Manjeet Budania, Sanika Khadkikar, Utkarsh<br />
 Rastogi, Vedanth Narayan, Gautam Tota, Prathmesh Jagtap, Ajith Reddy,<br />
Konark Joshi, Aditya Vashisth, Ankur Indauliya have been instrumental in<br />
 getting us to where we are today. I really hope I’m not missing any<br />
names. :)</p>
