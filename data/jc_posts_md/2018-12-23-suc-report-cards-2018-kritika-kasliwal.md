<h1>Help Initialization: In Progress</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The idea behind this was to ease the introduction of new sports on<br />
campus (Girls' Football, Tennis and Ultimate Frisbee) by "organising<br />
workshops" and focussing on  "coaching and provision of required<br />
equipment", ideas which are slightly similar to <a href="https://github.com/journal-club/wiki-data/blob/master/news/spotlight/suc-report-card-2018/kritika-kasliwal.md#sports-in-hostel-in-progress">points 4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/journal-club/wiki-data/blob/master/news/spotlight/suc-report-card-2018/kritika-kasliwal.md#coach-fulfilled">5</a><br />
 in this manifesto. This year a Tennis Girls' team (consisting of only<br />
two girls) was formed, and the Sports' Secretary (girls) said that steps<br />
 have been taken to initiate a Futsal team as well.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Orientation: Fulfilled</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This manifesto point proposed to organize "at least 2 workshops for<br />
each sport in the first month...". The Sports Secretary said that this<br />
would improve the existing culture and build the sports spirit among the<br />
 freshers. Workshops for most the sports were organized, and a detailed<br />
timetable of the workshops was also uploaded to BPHC ShoutBox. The<br />
Sports Secretary said that one whole day was dedicated to discussing<br />
sports on campus during the Freshmen Orientation 2018. (this point is<br />
slightly similar to the next point, which also talks about workshops)</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Workshops: Fulfilled</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Sports Secretary proposed that a "well tabulated calendar" be<br />
made for organizing sports workshops on campus. All the girls’ sports<br />
teams conducted workshops that went on for multiple days and timetable<br />
was devised and was posted on BPHC ShoutBoxx for students on campus to<br />
participate. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bphcshoutbox/permalink/1993918424004092/">Link to timetable</a></p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Sports in Hostel: In Progress</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Sports Secretary said that the courts in girls' hostels are being<br />
 maintained regularly, as are the inventory for Throwball, Volleyball<br />
and Carrom. Apart from this, the Sports Secretary said that the Table<br />
Tennis tables have been replaced. The only shortcoming in this segment<br />
is the inventory for Table Tennis and Badminton, which couldn't be<br />
replaced over apprehensions that students might misuse them. The<br />
manifesto also talked about indoor sports and activitiessuch as "Martial<br />
 Arts, Self Defence, Yoga, and Zumba", which haven't manifested yet. The<br />
 Sports Secretary said that instructors for these were not factored into<br />
 this semester’s budget and hence this could not be fulfilled.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h1><a href="https://github.com/journal-club/wiki-data/blob/master/news/spotlight/suc-report-card-2018/kritika-kasliwal.md#coach-fulfilled"></a></h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Coach: Fulfilled</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This point on the manifesto proposed for "provision of trained<br />
coaches specifically for girls' sports teams". Almost all the teams<br />
except for badminton have a coach. However, some teams have a coach on<br />
an on-call basis.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/journal-club/wiki-data/blob/master/news/spotlight/suc-report-card-2018/kritika-kasliwal.md#gym-not-fulfilled"></a></h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Gym: Not Fulfilled</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This point proposed the provision of a separate gym for girls on the<br />
ground floor of SAC and "separate [gym] timings on some days of the week<br />
 for girls" along with a female gym instructor. The secretary feels that<br />
 this point is not feasible because the administration wants all the<br />
facilities to be equal among students. As a result, it was decided to<br />
put cardio on the first floor and weight training below because girls<br />
would rather work on cardio. New treadmills are being installed on the<br />
first floor to accommodate for the higher crowd that cardio garners.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Increase Outside Participation: Fulfilled</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The sports captains have a calendar of all tournaments and events<br />
coming in the semester. This increased outside participation, with prior<br />
 information, there was good practice. Our teams attended BOSM, MEC,<br />
CBIT, and IITH. We have also seen an increase in medals this semester.<br />
Our teams have earned 14 medals over the course of this semester, which<br />
they usually earn over the duration of a year.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h1><a href="https://github.com/journal-club/wiki-data/blob/master/news/spotlight/suc-report-card-2018/kritika-kasliwal.md#dietician-and-nutritionist-not-fulfilled"></a></h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Dietician and Nutritionist: Not Fulfilled</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This point proposed a nutritionist to be available in college for<br />
help in setting "diet for sports players". This couldn't happen so far<br />
as this expense wasn't a partof the budget for the first semester. The<br />
Sports Secretary (Girls) also mentioned that women<br />
dieticians/nutritionists aren’t ready to come as far as our campus when<br />
they were reached out.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Cycle Marathons: Not Fulfilled</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This manifesto point talked about introducing "monthly cycle<br />
marathons in collaboration with Cykul" which haven't happened yet.  The<br />
Sports Secretary said that the plan to conduct Cycle Marathons was now<br />
replaced with a Duathlon which would be conducted during Arena.<br />
(Duathlon is not a new event this Arena - even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bits.arena/photos/a.168611119958361/933692286783570">Arena 2018 had this event</a>).<br />
 She also mentioned that they would not with be partnering with Cykul as<br />
 they are not in touch with them anymore. Once a deal is worked out<br />
with, she intends to conduct two or three marathons. The manifesto point<br />
 however clearly mentioned "monthly cycle marathons" which have clearly<br />
not happened yet.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Sports Secretary also talked to us about other general issues on compus.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>The participation during the Independence Day Run spiked from 40-50 participants to 200+.</li>
<li><strong>SAC Equipment Changes</strong>: This year the administration has put in a lot of effort with changing and adding gym equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Red Bull Tournament</strong>: The two sports secretaries together helped organise the Futsal and Badminton tournaments in collaboration with RedBull.</li>
<li><strong>Devil’s Circuit Campus Frenzy</strong>: This semester Devil’s circuit saw participation from a BITS contingent</li>
<li>Teachers' day matches were held for football, volleyball, tennis and badminton</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Sports Secretary also said that she believes that our sports<br />
teams are improving - BPHC won every single one of the friendly matches<br />
with IITH. The medals earned by our sports teams are increasing<br />
exponentially, as they are encouraged to participate in more tournaments<br />
 and events. The Sports Secretary also mentioned that in the budget for<br />
the next semester, the prize money for events during Arena has been<br />
increased.</p>
