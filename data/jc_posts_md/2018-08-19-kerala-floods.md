<p> For a state that is branded as God’s Own Country, the monsoon season this year has definitely turned it about into the Devil’s Playground. With an unprecedented increase in the rainfall this year in Kerala, there has been widespread chaos and floods throughout the entire state. Amongst all the terror and confusion caused, one begets the question. How did this happen? </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>The rainy season was not unexpected. However, the sheer volume of rainfall has not been seen in decades. In a state where there exist 42 dams, the government was faced with a dilemma. Should the dams be left closed and risk an even greater catastrophe? Or should a few be opened to release the water that they withheld? In time, the choice to be taken became apparent, with rains building steady in intensity, volume and sheer power. Nearly every dam has already been opened to reduce the pressure on the structures, and for the first time in history, all 5 reservoir gates of the largest arch dam in Asia, namely the Idukki Dam, were opened. The resulting floods hit multiple areas throughout the state, with all fourteen districts being in red alerts currently. Widespread evacuations and relief aid is being provided to the people affected. There has also been a rise in the number of people displaced from their homes, the numbers now surmounting to lakhs. The number of lives lost in this deluge. is also disturbing, with at least 370 dead as per the current statistics available. There have also been high economic losses, with the Kerala Government estimating the losses amounting to nearly 397 crores. All the flights through CIAL (Cochin International Airport Limited) have now been cancelled, and some on standby, while trains are currently operating on a minimal basis. Evacuation efforts by the Government and multiple NGOs (Non-Governmental Organisation) such as NSS (National Service Scheme) etc. are currently in full swing, with more than 4000 families already displaced and rescued. One of the most directly hit regions was the district of Ernakulam. It witnessed intense rainfall, with floodwater reaching nearly two storeys in heights in multiple towns such as Perumbavoor, Aluva and Kalady. As the current statistics hold, a total of 12 out of the 14 districts in Kerala are on the receiving end of the brunt of the calamity.</p>

<p>The relief forces are working to the very best of their abilities hoping that the rains cease at the earliest. Although most dams have been opened, continued rains will affect the existing structures, which may cause even further catastrophe. There has been relief aid from other states as well as private parties and the affected offer their gratitude for the help in these dire circumstances, many citing that this is a test of their faith, with massive prayer groups being held at the refugee camps.</p>
