<p> As of the First Semester 2019-20, the Sports Secretary (Girls) has fulfilled 4/7 of her manifesto points, 2/7 are in progress and 1/7 have not been fulfilled at all. You can find her original manifesto <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/ElectionCommissionBPHC/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=2315904078653247&amp;ref=page_internal">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZING WORKSHOPS: FULFILLED</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The idea behind this point is to bring freshers to the field and she claims that the number of workshops has increased this semester. The sports secretary aims to increase the number of workshops every month for the benefit of the freshers on campus. As per the Secretary, as of the first semester, almost all sports had their respective workshops quite regularly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION OF A NEW SPORT: FULFILLED</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Kho-Kho was introduced as a new sport despite Siri’s manifesto being about Handball. She explained this by saying that Handball could not be introduced due to inadequate facilities for the sport. Also, the field proposed for the latter seemed more appropriate for Kho-Kho, hence the change. The beginning of the semester saw the start of a new Kho-Kho team.</p>

<p>Proper maintenance of the common room inventory and QT areas of the girls’ hostels is one of her manifesto points. She has raised this point in front of the concerned authorities. She told us that they responded positively and that it might take some time for leveling the QT ground. Inventory for football, volleyball, and board games would also be maintained at the hostels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to the huge expenses and the isolated location of our campus, Siri admits that we are not able to hire a nutritionist. However, she, along with Praneeth Setty (Sports Secretary - Boys) has planned to bring a nutritionist to the campus a week before Arena.&nbsp;</p>
