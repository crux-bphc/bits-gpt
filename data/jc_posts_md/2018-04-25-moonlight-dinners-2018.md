<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On the midnight of 21st February 2018, the SMC announced a “Moonlight Dinner<sup>1</sup>”<br />
 (MLD) scheduled for 25th of the same month. It was intended to be a<br />
‘delightful dinner to promote student-faculty interaction’. However, the<br />
 general body was evidently disappointed as the dinner certainly failed<br />
to justify the hype surrounding it. The SMC@BPHC<sup>2</sup> group was<br />
flooded with a plethora of complaints ranging from sub-standard food<br />
quality to dusty conditions around the dining area following the dinner.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The menu only had trivial additions compared to a traditional gala<br />
dinner with many complaining that the food was what they’d have gotten<br />
on any other Sunday night and the cost wasn’t justified given that the<br />
snacks were canceled for the day.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you look at it, the event was already gaining quite a buzz even<br />
before it started owing to the ambiguity surrounding the menu till the<br />
very last moment<sup>3</sup>, and the uncertainty of any opt-out<br />
procedure for the dinner. To clarify the latter, a comment was dropped<br />
on the main post to which none of the SMC members replied<sup>4</sup>.<br />
In fact, a reply suggesting to opt for a grace on Sunday showed up, and<br />
that too wasn’t ratified by any of those in the SMC. To investigate into<br />
 this, we decided to write two emails to the SWD office on the 2nd of<br />
March asking for the status of the graces applied for 25th February, to<br />
which we still await a response as of 12th March 2018. Later that day<br />
when asked, Mess-1 officials confirmed to us that all graces applied for<br />
 25th February were canceled without any prior notice to the general<br />
body. No notice was pinned on the boards as of 2nd March and neither of<br />
the mess officials directed us towards any form of official<br />
communication to confirm it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The original post regarding the dinner announced that it would be<br />
organized by Aditya Caterers, which lead us to ask: “Why not Shakthi<br />
caterers (Mess-2)?” Mess-2 officials<sup>5</sup> told us that they had<br />
been given the responsibility to host a second Moonlight Dinner<br />
scheduled in the first week of April. This was decided along with the<br />
first MLD. This too was done without general body’s consensus.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now the above revelations trigger some grave concerns about the<br />
actions of the current SMC. Firstly, why was the MLD compulsory? And<br />
even if it was, why not consider having a poll for the date as it is<br />
done for a gala dinner<sup>6</sup>. An additional amount was deducted from our mess balances<sup>7</sup> which brings us to our next question. Do mess deductions need the approval of the general body<sup>8</sup>?<br />
 If not, who decides how much to deduct and for what? More importantly,<br />
where do we draw the line? If a ₹100 deduction for something like Arena<br />
justifies a GBM, then why not have one for a ₹62 deduction for an MLD?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The questions we want to ask are essentially:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li>Why was it compulsory?</li>
<li>Why didn’t I get to choose the date?</li>
<li>Why is there a second one?</li>
<li>Who approved the deduction from my account?</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to the Constitution<sup>9</sup>, the SMC is only a communication channel between the mess and the students<sup>10</sup><br />
 but clearly, their role seems to have evolved to deal with more. It<br />
would be beneficial to the general body if the roles and<br />
responsibilities of various bodies were updated with time.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>The manager of Mess-2 told us some details of the<br />
proposed dinner; 500 plates would be made available for faculty and<br />
staff at no cost to them, the price of the second dinner would be the<br />
same, but the menu was yet to be decided.</p>
