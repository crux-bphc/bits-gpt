<p>The quarantine can get really boring and you must most definitely be looking for productive ways to spend your time. We at the Journal Club have compiled a list of online courses that you could try out to learn something new and explore some interesting fields of study.</p>

<p>Machine learning comprises a study of algorithms that help the system perform certain tasks without having to be programmed with explicit instructions. These systems purely rely on patterns and inferences.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An introductory course to Machine Learning taught by Andrew Ng, one of the pioneers in the field. The course starts from the very basics of the field such as Regression algorithms and builds up to advanced algorithms such as Neural Networks. The only possible downside to this course is that the assignments are to be done in MATLAB/ OCTAVE, this is quite redundant and outdated because most of the Machine Learning practitioners have shifted to Python.</p>

<p>Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning which mainly focuses on neural networks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This five-course specialization takes you through the various aspects of understanding a neural network and the different varieties in it. With the mini-projects that are part of the course, you learn to build some really interesting applications such as cat vs. dog classifiers to analyze sequence and time-series data.</p>

<p>Reinforcement Learning also comes under the broader umbrella of machine learning but in this field, the notion of a reward is introduced. The system in any given environment has to work in such a way that it optimizes the reward. This is modeled in a similar fashion in which little kids are taught.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Reinforcement Learning is one of the most edge fields of Machine Learning. This course assumes that you have some prior knowledge in the field and builds on top of that. The course is well structured with equal parts of theory and practical coding practice. It is the best way to enter the field of Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<p>Codeacademy is one of the best places to learn a new programming language. It’s easy to navigate the user interface and tests at the end of every lesson help you learn with ease. They offer a course in Python 3, you can check that out <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3">here</a>. The course starts from scratch, it assumes that the student has no prior coding knowledge.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It teaches the basics of the language such as the syntax and the common data structures, slowly builds up to functions and classes. This also covers a lot of important concepts from the object-oriented programming paradigm.</p>

<p>Java is one of the most popular languages, it also is the preferred language for the Object Object Programming course offered by our university. The website <a href="https://www.learnjavaonline.org/">here</a> is one of the best resources online to learn the language.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What is imperative when it comes to knowledge in data structures and algorithms is the number of questions that you have practiced, not the certifications or the courses that you have completed. A good place to start would be <a href="https://codeforces.com/">here</a>. Start with problems labeled A and once you have gained enough experience, move on to problems of higher difficulty such as B and later on C.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is also important to focus on the theory to be able to solve questions with ease.</p>

<p>Difficulty Level: Intermediate</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This course believes that you have some prior experience in coding (at least that you have completed CS F111). It starts from the very basics of data structures such as Stacks and Queues and moves on to explain the basic sorting algorithms.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the second course, you are taught about graphs and graph-based algorithms such as Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search.</p>

<p>This comprehensive playlist would help you gain a fairly thorough understanding of Quantum Physics. The course takes you through Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Relativity, Particle Physics, String Theory, and everything in between. Look out for the playlist posted by ‘Chaz K. Shand’ as a brief break-up of the modules is given in the description of his playlist. You can then choose to selectively complete the topics of your interest. The above listed two particle physics playlists are also a part of this master playlist.</p>
