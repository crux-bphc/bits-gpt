<p>On 19th April, 2018, the President of the SUC 2018-2019 posted a<br />
notice on BPHC Shoutbox calling all students from the 2016 batch for<br />
selection to the posts of Fest Coordinator for ATMOS, Arena and Pearl<br />
respectively. The notice stated a GBM would be held later on to<br />
“formalise the posts” and “set specific roles and boundaries” for these<br />
posts.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The selection procedure includes “filtration of applicants based on<br />
their SOPs, interview with the outgoing President, respective<br />
Secretaries of the fest, General Secretary and outgoing FOB, with each<br />
having one vote, in the presence of EC, CRC, incoming SUC and FOB”<br />
followed by which “the candidate who gets more votes will be appointed<br />
as Fest Coordinator”.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the proposal to appoint Fest Coordinators for<br />
ATMOS, Arena and Pearl from the academic year 2018-2019 was brought up<br />
at the GBM held on 15th November, 2017, where it was explained that<br />
while the SUC is elected for the welfare of the campus, they have<br />
conventionally been focussing more on fests. Hence, the post of a Fest<br />
Coordinator would be necessary, “as the representative of the President<br />
during a fest. The Fest Coordinator would be the head of the concerned<br />
departments (the CoStAA/StuCCA/CoSSAC body) of the fest” and “the<br />
Secretary will head the Senate”. Out of the 335 General Body members<br />
present, 191 members voted in favour, initiating further discussion on<br />
said idea in the future. However, considering how this was less than<br />
two-thirds of the General Body members, the proposal could not be<br />
implemented.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now, a few questions arise. Is the President of the SUC 2018-2019<br />
eligible to select people to posts for the coming academic year when his<br />
 tenure hasn’t begun yet? Does the notice given out by him hold any<br />
value in light of the result of the GBM that previously took place? What<br />
 exact role will the EC hold in this selection procedure?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To answer these questions, Journal Club got in touch with the EC and the President of the SUC 2018-2019.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The current SUC can appoint people to positions now along with the<br />
new FOB, provided their tenure starts along with the SUC, that is, at<br />
the beginning of the next academic year. Coming to the question of how<br />
this proposal is moving forward in spite of the lack of the support of<br />
2/3rd of the General Body present for the GBM where it was brought up,<br />
the EC stated that since it was passed by 1/3rd of the people attending,<br />
 it is important enough to be discussed. Further, what is being done<br />
right now is unofficial and “the EC or the CRC won’t recognize any<br />
powers of the Fest Coordinators for 2018-2019”.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is still unclear as to how the Fest Coordinator will function if<br />
the post is “unofficial” and not recognized by the EC or the CRC,<br />
considering how it is unknown as to whom they are accountable to and<br />
what the boundaries of their powers are just as yet.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The notice on Shoutbox also mentions that these selections will take<br />
place under the supervision of the EC and the CRC although these posts<br />
are not constitutionally recognized. The EC explained that this is<br />
“merely to involve a neutral selection process” and that “the EC shall<br />
have no vote”. Should the SUC choose to disregard the opinion of the EC,<br />
 “they’re free to do so because as of now there’s nothing written,<br />
binding on them.”<br />
The President of the SUC 2018-2019 has stated that while the idea of a<br />
Fest Coordinator has been in the pipeline since 2016-2017, it couldn’t<br />
be implemented till date. The outgoing SUC and the FOB have been<br />
entrusted with appointing these candidates as their experience will help<br />
 the new SUC in choosing the right people.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Further, he stated that for the year 2018-2019, the post of Fest<br />
Coordinator will be an “unofficial” one and is being implemented on an<br />
experimental basis. While the proposal to implement these posts was not<br />
successfully passed when brought up in the GBM, he still feels the SUC<br />
has the authority to create these positions. He also feels that there<br />
was a lot of “confusion” regarding this vote, so it shouldn’t count.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Coming to the role of the Fest Coordinator, since there is no fixed<br />
description of the role just as yet, they will be selected on the basis<br />
of who has the most fest-related experience for each fest. Moreover, it<br />
will mainly be an advisory role to help integrate the work of the clubs<br />
and departments during fests. The “filtration of candidates” clause in<br />
the selection procedure is only to shortlist the best candidates faster<br />
if they receive too many applications, as the SUC aims to appoint the<br />
Fest Coordinators by the end of this week so that they can begin working<br />
 from the start of the next academic year.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>He said that while the decision to appoint Fest Coordinators wasn’t<br />
entirely the idea of the President 2017-2018, it was his call. He said<br />
that it was a combined decision but the call was his as the President<br />
2018-2019 doesn’t have the power to take a decision right now as he is<br />
not a part of the office yet. Although the EC has confirmed that the<br />
President 2018-2019 does indeed have the power to appoint people who<br />
will be working during his tenure, when this fact was brought to his<br />
notice he said that he was not aware that he had this power.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Considering all of these facts, there still remain a lot of grey<br />
areas in terms of the selection, implementation and responsibilities of<br />
the Fest Coordinators, and other members of the SUC, in general, and it<br />
is a sincere hope that light is shed on these areas for the benefit of<br />
the General Body.</p>
