<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Sexual harassment is frighteningly common. The UGC reported a 50%<br />
increase in the number of cases since 2017. A total of 188 cases were<br />
reported from institutions across the country in 2017.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The most vulnerable targets of sexual harassment from faculty at<br />
universities are research students. This is not to say that there is no<br />
chance of undergraduates being harassed. However, research students work<br />
 with a greater degree of proximity to and depend heavily on their<br />
supervisors. In the unfortunate case of their supervisor happening to be<br />
 a predator, these students are left almost powerless.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To protect students from such harm, the UGC in 2015 made it<br />
compulsory for all colleges in India to have a special committee to<br />
handle these complaints, and also to prevent the occurrence of sexual<br />
harassment. With the UGC itself about to be dismantled by the present<br />
government, the fate of the ICC hangs in doubt. However, as of 2018, in<br />
accordance with this mandate, BPHC has an Internal Complaints Committee.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The fact that the ICC is such a little-known body on campus, sticks<br />
out like a sore thumb. While all other committees, their functions and<br />
procedures that help students (Anti-ragging, counsellors, SWD, etc.) are<br />
 explicitly made known to us, the ICC has never been publicized as much,<br />
 save for a poster on the HSS notice board.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is not surprising, because the existence of sexual harassment is<br />
 something nobody wants to acknowledge. It would do no favour to anyone<br />
to talk about it, except perhaps for the victim, who would be aware of<br />
an option available to him/her. And perhaps for potential perpetrators,<br />
who would be wary of possible punishment.</p>

<h2>What is Sexual Harassment?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, what is sexual harassment? Most people conjure up images of rape<br />
and molestation of women. However, physical abuse isn’t the whole<br />
picture. The government defines any unwelcome physical, verbal or<br />
non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature as sexual harassment, whether<br />
directly or by implication.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As per the Handbook on Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace,<br />
the key elements of sexual harassment are that it is “sexual, unwelcome<br />
and the experience is subjective. <strong>It is the impact and not the intent that matters.</strong>”</p>

<h3>Key features of the ICC</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ICC’s responsibility is to keep a check of sexual harassment<br />
occurring in the campus. Which includes teaching and non teaching staff,<br />
 students as well as outsiders who might visit the campus.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To investigate and take action on any complaint of sexual harassment<br />
brought to its notice, directly by the victim or through the victim’s<br />
trusted friend/aide in a neutral, non-biased way.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It should maintain the anonymity of the victim/ complainant and the accused/respondent throughout the proceedings.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It should support the victim if the she/he chooses to lodge legal proceedings.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It should listen and record statements of both the victim and the accused patiently and in a non-biased way.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Also it has to spread awareness among the students and staff about<br />
the mechanism in place to handle complaints of sexual harassment.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ICC should have three student representatives who shall be<br />
enrolled  at UG, master’s and Ph.D respectively through transparent<br />
election procedure. The other members include faculty, non teaching<br />
staff as well as a member from an NGO outside.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It has to complete the inquiry within 90 days of the receiving the<br />
complaint and submit a final report to the Institute Head within 10 days<br />
 thereafter.</p>

<h3>The ICC on our campus</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ICC at our campus mainly handles complaints of sexual harassment by faculty and staff.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The cases of sexual harassment by students are usually handled by the<br />
 Disciplinary Committee. But if any such case approaches the ICC, they<br />
are responsible for its resolution and inquiry.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Till date there haven’t been any complaint that has required very<br />
serious actions. But as a precaution, the ICC has monitored several<br />
individuals over the months.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The student representatives, although not elected, have been active<br />
in guiding students who approach them towards the ICC so that their<br />
grievances can be heard.<br />
The ICC said that elections would not have been feasible for such a<br />
committee as there would be very few students interested in such a post.</p>

<h3>Problems with running an ICC</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The greatest challenge to the ICC today is the lack of complaints<br />
they receive. On first glance, this statement might seem silly. Isn’t<br />
the low number of complaints a good thing? But the reality is darker-<br />
harassment is more widespread than it is vocalized.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Most students are too afraid to lodge a formal complaint with anyone.<br />
 Horrifying and dehumanising experiences stay within circles of friends,<br />
 becoming the shared, common knowledge that is expected to be brushed<br />
under the carpet and ignored. It is far easier to be silent than to<br />
vocalize trauma that will in all likelihood increase when they attempt<br />
to hold the perpetrator accountable.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to the chairperson of ICC at BPHC, most cases among staff<br />
and faculty don’t reach the ICC as they are resolved among their<br />
respective departments under the HoD.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another obstacle for the ICC stated by the chairperson, is the lack<br />
of interest among students regarding these issues. There were events<br />
organised in this context by the ICC which witnessed very poor<br />
attendance by students.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The lack of awareness among students is another thing that is<br />
preventing ICC from functioning to its true function. The chairperson<br />
said that this is despite several attempts by the ICC to spread<br />
awareness regarding these issues.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Determining legitimacy of a claim</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ICC checks legitimacy by monitoring the accused’s behaviour over a<br />
 period of time. This monitoring is attempted to be done covertly and<br />
without bias.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To quote the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act  -<br />
“In order to ensure that the protections...are not misused, provisions<br />
for action against “false or malicious” complainants have been<br />
included...that the allegation made by the complainant is false or<br />
malicious or the complaint has been made knowing it to be untrue or<br />
forged or misleading information has been provided during the inquiry,<br />
disciplinary action in accordance with the service rules of the<br />
organisation can be taken against such complainant.”</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>The Likelihood of a False Accusation</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is worth reiterating here that both the accused and the accuser’s<br />
identities are kept confidential. Every claim is closely examined and<br />
punishments if found guilty, have included a warning, and in another<br />
cases, a fine.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is also worth noting that a formal complaint is not immediately<br />
filed as soon as a person approaches the ICC. Only when attempts at<br />
reconciliation and warnings do not suffice, is the complaint formalized.<br />
 All the while maintaining anonymity.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In other words, the reputation of the accused even when proven guilty, remains intact.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The chairperson of the ICC states that cases are hardly reported. The ICC has yet to find a case where the claim made was false.<br />
The reality is, sexual harassment is far more common than false accusations.</p>

<h2>The Way Forward</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The present ICC is set to continue to function in the coming years.<br />
(The term is three years, with effect from 2017). The contacts of the<br />
members are detailed in the notice linked below. If anyone is undergoing<br />
 sexual harassment, they musn't hesitate to resolve the matter.<br />
With the fate of the ICC in doubt, it is unclear whether a new body (if<br />
any) will have the same provisions. In any case, it is hoped that our<br />
systems evolve into strong mechanisms that hold wrongdoers accountable<br />
for their actions. Our universities must become places where we<br />
flourish, learn and grow. Not places that breed and harbour<br />
disrespectful, dehumanising and illegal behavior.</p>
