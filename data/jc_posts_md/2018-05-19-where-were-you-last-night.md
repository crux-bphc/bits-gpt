<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Two hours after midnight every day, BITS campus reverberates with the<br />
 sound of the hostel chowkidars’ whistle, signaling to all the nocturnal<br />
 wanderers that it’s time to tuck in for the night. Girls and boys head<br />
back to their respective hostels before the Bhawan gates close, lest<br />
they’re left to fend for themselves in the cold, dark night outside.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Before going to their rooms however, the girls give proof of their<br />
return to the hostel through a biometric scanner. The system of<br />
biometric attendance is a wonderful safety measure, a way to monitor and<br />
 ensure that the student is present and healthy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Every time a student doesn’t give biometric, it is registered in the<br />
hostel supervisor’s records. The next day when the chowkidar sees the<br />
student on her way in or out of the hostel, she is made to sign an<br />
undertaking citing her reasons for not giving biometric attendance. But,<br />
 if the student is not seen by the chowkidar outside her room, the<br />
assistant supervisor goes to the student’s room to check if she’s in her<br />
 room and is ok, following which she is made to sign the undertaking.<br />
Considering most of us at BITS are allotted single rooms, this protocol<br />
of checking up on the students makes certain that the student is not in<br />
any peril due to ill health or any other reason for that matter.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Then why is such an important safekeeping measure only restricted to<br />
the girls? Does the administration not care enough about the safety of<br />
its male students? Why isn’t a similar system of checks implemented for<br />
the boys?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unless of course the biometric system is used less as a means of<br />
safekeeping and more as a means to police our movements as is evident by<br />
 the undertaking. If the intention is safety then one signature the next<br />
 day as proof of well being should be enough. Instead, the undertaking<br />
demands that we give one of 3 options reason for not marking attendance:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li>I was outside campus without taking prior permission and outstation form.</li>
<li>I was on campus but did not return back to my hostel room.</li>
<li>I was inside the hostel but didn’t give attendance due to negligence.</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If a student is well and normal the next day, why is she made to<br />
declare her whereabouts? What purpose does this serve? For the past week<br />
 or so, the hostel assistants are even going door-to-door to note down<br />
which rooms are locked after 2 AM to correspond with the reason the<br />
student gives in her undertaking. When a student doesn’t give biometric<br />
attendance for many days, she is made to go and talk to the warden.<br />
Often students have even been asked to call their parents. These<br />
consequences of not giving biometric however seem to be arbitrary and<br />
subjective, completely based on the biases and discretion of the<br />
supervisors. While some girls were left scot-free even after foregoing<br />
biometric for a number of days, some were made to call their parents<br />
just after two days even though the undertaking was signed on both days.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Boys, on the other hand, do not have any system to check their<br />
whereabouts despite having a 2 AM cutoff. As long as they are not caught<br />
 outside during the night they are basically left alone and face no<br />
consequences whatsoever. This means that they can also go out of the<br />
campus and remain outside without an outstation form, while girls have<br />
to get their parents to call the supervisor and take prior permission,<br />
grown-up Ph.D. students included.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You might wonder what is the problem in declaring one’s whereabouts<br />
if she hasn’t done anything wrong? Why is the student reluctant to call<br />
her parents if she knows she’s on the right?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Well, it is a matter of principle. Why should an adult over the age<br />
of 18, capable of making her own decisions be put through these<br />
situations?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One would then argue that this is a college with its own rules to<br />
enforce discipline, that the students need to adhere to by virtue of<br />
being a part of this community.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But why then are these rules imposed only on a section of the population and not on all individuals?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If the sole motive of biometric attendance was safety then there are<br />
better methods to implement it. Calls can and should be made to parents<br />
if the whereabouts of the students are not known to the administration<br />
and if they believe the student’s well being is somehow threatened. But<br />
the way it is done now seems unfair, prejudiced and is an extremely<br />
convenient way to shame girls for what their male counterparts do not<br />
have to think twice about.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While every system has pros and cons, this one certainly can be used in a more proper way.</p>
