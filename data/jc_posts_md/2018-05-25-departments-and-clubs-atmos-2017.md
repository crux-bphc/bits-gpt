<h2>DoSM</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Department of Sponsorship and Management or DoSM as we know it,<br />
proved their mettle yet again by bringing in an incredible amount of<br />
sponsorship for the fest. This year they managed to confirm the<br />
smartphone giant Oppo and telecom behemoth Jio along with other players<br />
in their fields. They’ve already leapfrogged the benchmark set by the<br />
last year’s events and are looking to raise the bar for the upcoming<br />
years. This year, like the preceding ones but with more emphasis,<br />
sponsors were strategically chosen to smoothen the pitching process. As<br />
for the team, it is touted to be one of the best teams ever, with<br />
experienced and talented seniors eagerly heading a team of fervent<br />
sophomores and freshmen to make ATMOS the best it can be.</p>

<h2>Arts and Deco</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Department of Arts and Deco is working day and night in order to<br />
beautify our already stunning campus in the colours of this year’s theme<br />
 for the ATMOS: A Neon Dystopia. Their squad, comprising of motivated<br />
freshers guided by experienced seniors are all set to make a mark on the<br />
 fest with their unreal artefacts and creativity gracing every turn and<br />
corner of the campus, making it one of the best ever decorations. This<br />
year, the department also took an inspiring initiative and called out<br />
for waste materials such as plastic bottles from the entire campus and<br />
swore to put it all into use by using them for the decoration purposes.<br />
Now that’s what you call “celebrating responsibly”.</p>

<h2>DePP</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Department of Publicity and Public Relations continues to amaze<br />
everyone with their professionalism and sheer brilliance this year as<br />
ATMOS inches closer every day. According to the CoStaan of the<br />
department, the PR database has improved compared to the preceding year<br />
with nearly 350 people registering themselves as Campus Ambassadors for<br />
their respective colleges, showcasing the reach of the fest. He credits<br />
all of this to crafting of suitable strategies and executing them well<br />
ahead of time to avoid any last moment hassles. The department also<br />
managed to bring the fest under the spotlight by publicising it via<br />
various print (e.g. Sakshi), virtual and social media platforms, not to<br />
mention the college visits they’re doing to expand the local reach. This<br />
 year’s team of DePP is doing a commendable job to ensure the grand<br />
success of ATMOS.</p>

<h2>DoPE</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Department of Professional Events, also known as DoPE on campus,<br />
has some amazing pro-shows lined up for this ATMOS. From contacting the<br />
artists till the signing of the contract, this department had a lot of<br />
work etched out this ATMOS. All the members of the department seem to be<br />
 working double time as they keep confirming great artists for the<br />
events. With big names, such as Rahul Subramaniam and The Local Train<br />
all set to perform in our campus, the footfall is expected to increase.<br />
The newly created department has started their work on an amazing note<br />
and has set the bar high for future fests.</p>

<h2>DoTA</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>DoTA has definitely outdone itself this fest. They had been entrusted  with the huge responsibility of the ATMOS website and the posters for  the fest, and they delivered with work surpassing all expectations. With  the absolutely unique ATMOS website becoming one of the main points of  interest for the fest, credit needs to be given where it’s due; DoTA has  more than earned it with their achievements this time. The posters  released online are attracting a large audience, thus increasing the  outreach of ATMOS. Their job, this ATMOS, has been completed with flair  and time to spare.</p>

<h2>Department of Visual Effects (DoVE)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The members of the Department of Visual Effects worked day and night<br />
to shoot and edit the footage of every event that was happening all<br />
around the campus during ATMOS. From the Competitions and talks to the<br />
pro shows and the interviews of the speakers, they had it all covered.<br />
Thanks to the workshops held before ATMOS the newcomers were well<br />
prepared. They also got to learn new techniques of shooting and an<br />
experience in editing. With all the amazing shots captured and the<br />
technical prowess of their members, the aftermovie is expected to be<br />
top-notch.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Department of Security and Hospitality (DoSH)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This ATMOS, DoSH efficiently managed the ever-increasing footfall<br />
without faltering at any moment. Even though DoSH is a huge department,<br />
everyone knew their jobs and completed all its duties with a skillful<br />
task force comprising of experienced seniors and enthusiastic juniors.<br />
The workload was distributed equally and all the members worked for the<br />
smooth functioning of the fest. The new ideas which originated for<br />
handling the large crowds were effectively communicated. DoSH did not<br />
leave any stone unturned to increase the convenience of the participants<br />
 as always.</p>

<h2>Lights and Sound Department (LSD)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Lights and Sound Department had a huge task of taking care of all<br />
 the audio-visual requirements during ATMOS. With as many as 15 setups<br />
running simultaneously during the fest, the work-force was not only<br />
efficient but also proficient in coordinating with the other<br />
departments. They ensured that every event gets their lights and sounds<br />
requirements so that the events run smoothly. They worked tediously to<br />
ensure that the lights and sound production of the pro-shows were up to<br />
the mark. The DJ Nite conducted by them during the fest made ATMOS more<br />
festive.</p>

<p>DoRA, the Department of Recreational Activities, oversaw the<br />
provision of leisure activities which acted as huge stress-busters and<br />
rejuvenated the body in between the hectic schedule of ATMOS. Their main<br />
 event, 'Man of Drones', was a wonderful learning experience for many<br />
people who got to know how to control drones using gestures. Also, DoRA<br />
made sure that the participants do not feel bored even for a minute with<br />
 their 24/7 gaming area having LAN gaming and console gaming. All in<br />
all, the department proved its mettle in its first Fest and are now<br />
gearing up for many more fun-filled Fests.</p>

better than ever before and maintained the smooth functioning of the<br />

department, Controlz took care of all the logistic requirements of<br />
ATMOS. Considering the convenience of participants at upmost importance,<br />
