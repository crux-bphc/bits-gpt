<h3><a href="https://github.com/journal-club/wiki-data/blob/master/news/fests/atmos-17/president-interview.md#firstly-how-are-the-preparations-going"></a>Firstly, how are the preparations going?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We started off on a good note, had the events ready by the second<br />
week of June and the workshops confirmed by the second week of<br />
September.  The publicity went very well in the holidays: we have a<br />
great DePP team this year.  The patronages have also helped us a lot<br />
with publicity.  There was a bit of a halt last week, due to the<br />
Mid-Semester Exams and Diwali, but otherwise, the preparations have gone<br />
 very efficiently.</p>

<h3>In what ways do you think this ATMOS is going to be different, and better than the previous editions?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Last year, ATMOS, for us was a footfall fest, but this time we are<br />
converting it into an encouragement kind of a fest.  We have around 17<br />
workshops- all of them are top notch in quality.  We have managed to get<br />
 associated with Google Developers, Microsoft and IBM.  We have<br />
patronages from Make in India, Startup India and Digital India.<br />
This year’s ATMOS will be the best in terms of the quality of events and<br />
 prize money offered.  Even though ATMOS is clashing with many other<br />
events such as NIT Warangal’s Technozion, Sunburn, NH7 Weekender and the<br />
 Pune Comedy Festival, we still are getting a good outreach.  We hope to<br />
 get around 132 contingents from all across India.<br />
The advantage of getting patronages from Make in India, Startup India<br />
and Digital India is that the students get approved certificates with<br />
Make in India and Digital India logos along with ATMOS and BITS logos.<br />
All the events and workshops will be on par with the standards set by<br />
them.</p>

<h3>Are<br />
 there any aspects from the fests of previous years that you’d like to<br />
address during this ATMOS, and the entire academic year?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Compared to the previous editions of ATMOS, we’ve improved the quality and tried to improve the revenue generating sources.<br />
For me, this year’s edition of ATMOS is different compared to the<br />
previous ones as I am experimenting with a couple of things, like<br />
investing more and recovering the money through effective sponsorship.<br />
Hopefully, these experiments will prove to be fruitful, so that we can<br />
improve them and implement them in the other 2 fests.<br />
We have tried our hand at a social initiative for ATMOS this year.  We<br />
have already launched "The Blue Drop“ initiative, wherein members of<br />
Nirmaan have gone to schools for promoting water conservation.<br />
We are introducing cashless bill payments at the food stalls this year,<br />
for on-campus students.  It’s a simple system which deducts money from<br />
the “Other Advances”.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How has being the President changed your participation in the fest? How did you manage the workload?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It hasn't changed my view.  I always think as a general body member<br />
and then I take a decision.  I see whatever suits the general body’s<br />
interests the best and I go ahead with that.  ATMOS has been very<br />
special in my life ever since I came to campus.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first two years on campus, I learnt a lot about taking<br />
responsibilities and getting work done on time.  This year, it’s totally<br />
 different.  I am in a position of mentorship.  I direct the juniors to<br />
work.  I delegate them the work and ask them to do it.  So, I contribute<br />
 more ideas and being in a decision-making role, it gives me a lot of<br />
liberty to do new things over here.  This way the experience has been<br />
different this time.  It's is completely in your hands how you give it<br />
to the campus and the people coming to the fest.  So, it’s just shaping<br />
the fest totally from scratch.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I didn't become President for the fest.  I believe that the President<br />
 of the Student Union should work on improving the lives of students on<br />
the campus and that made me take up the responsibility.  Fests are the<br />
additional responsibilities we have, but from the next year, SU won't be<br />
 involved directly in the fest.  We plan on having a fest coordinator<br />
system from next year.  A middleman who will work between the SU and<br />
student’s fest.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Other than funds, how does the Administration participate in the organisation of the fest?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Whenever you want something from the management, you should have a<br />
lot of patience.  We get help from the General Administration Division<br />
with accommodation for the speakers and pro-show artists.  Every part of<br />
 the fest needs the support of the management.  When a VIP is coming,<br />
there is protocol that has to be followed.  We get mementos arranged.<br />
The administration helps us in handling the finances of the fest, not<br />
directly though.  Funds are an important aspect of the fest.  Without<br />
the funds and the approval of the administration, the fest cannot be<br />
organized at all.  We are backed by a very supportive administration<br />
which helps us run things smoothly.</p>

<h3>During the preparation of the fest, is there a moment that stands out? Any moment that could encapsulate the spirit of the fest?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For me, it’s all a huge collection of memories.  I can't just pick a<br />
random one because I feel involved in every part of the fest and I have<br />
been enjoying every single bit of it.<br />
Possibly when we confirmed the Google developer’s association, it added<br />
more value to the fest and more so to my happiness.  Whenever I receive<br />
calls from people in other cities, like the day someone from Thapar<br />
university called me and told me that he’d need this information for<br />
getting a 50-member contingent,  those are the moments which make me<br />
extremely happy.  Even after being busy with a lot of work over here, I<br />
have been going out to pitch companies and the news vendors so that we<br />
could place the ATMOS pamphlets over there to get fest publicity.  I’ve<br />
been doing all this for the past 2 years and it’s been immense fun all<br />
along the way.</p>

<h3>How do you handle disagreements with the FOB?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The FOB has been on the same page as me since day one, except a few<br />
times, but we were able to sort it out.  It has been quite an experience<br />
 working with these amazing people.  There have been situations where we<br />
 had disagreements, no denial.  But we managed to work our way around<br />
them.  I have always had their support, and they help me out in every<br />
way possible.  The members of the FOB and I have an amazing bond.</p>

<h3>How do you see ATMOS progressing in the future?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>PEARL has a lot of recognition in Hyderabad and other parts of India,<br />
 but for ATMOS we are building the brand, and ATMOS is already being<br />
recognized all over India now.  So, in the future, I see a lot of scope<br />
for activities and all kinds of revenue generation and profits.  The<br />
growth has been organic every year.  I don’t see a future where ATMOS<br />
will ever be scaled down because it is where we generate good profits.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>ATMOS, on the technical side of it, will go to different heights in<br />
terms of quality and technology in Hyderabad and outside the state.  At<br />
the same time, a lot of things have to be taken care of.  One shouldn’t<br />
overshoot for no reason or get involved in things which have a lot of<br />
risks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Even I would proudly say that ATMOS is the biggest tech fest in India<br />
 solely managed by the students.  I’m in the view that ATMOS should have<br />
 an organic growth.  The future of ATMOS is always secure and it is an<br />
increasing graph of progress.  You only have to experiment with various<br />
avenues and possibilities.</p>

<h3>In the three years that you have been a part of ATMOS, how have you grown, as a person, through the organisation of the fest?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I have always been a short tempered person but I’ve learnt to be<br />
patient over time.  This has given me an increased sense of<br />
responsibility.  As a person, it has almost been like an energy boost<br />
and an equally amazing morale boost.<br />
Everyone I knew tried to help me in all possible ways.  That is where I<br />
realized my true potential.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How did the outcome of the GBM affect the preparations for the Atmos?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My plan was always constant.  I did not change a single figure in it.<br />
  I did not want ATMOS to get affected by the GBMs, so I had a fixed<br />
action plan.  Come what may, my plan was for ATMOS to go unhindered.<br />
Whatever may be the result of the GBM, I made sure that the effect on<br />
ATMOS was minimal.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now that you guys are in college, you have a lot of things to explore<br />
 and you have to achieve.  It’s just that you shouldn’t lose your sense<br />
of direction.<br />
Whenever you are working for the campus, you shouldn’t lose heart and<br />
should always be motivated.  Find some self-motivation and some goal to<br />
look forward to.<br />
There is always a story waiting for you in the campus.  It is in your<br />
hands to go ahead and seek it.</p>
