Hello, dear fresher. Welcome to BITS Hyderabad, a place you’ll call home 
for the next few years. I hope that by the time you finish reading this 
Magazine, you’ll understand this college better and that it will help you in 
your time here. You will learn to manage life beyond academics, settle in 
these walls, and figure out the nitty-gritty of life on campus. You’re in for 
an exciting time, and I’ll try my best to share what I kept in mind during my 
first year and what worked for me.

Your first few days will be hectic, with you getting lost in the academic 
blocks, crossing 10k steps daily, and rushing from place to place on 
campus. You will also discover the freedom that comes with college, the 
fact that you can roam the campus anytime with no restrictions (maybe 
you’ll have a curfew for the first month). Don’t spend all your free time in 
your room. The campus is huge and sometimes scary, but college is about 
new experiences. Roam the campus, check out the sports grounds, the 
outlets, and their menus, and figure out how academic blocks are named. 

Don’t worry too much about academics, but don’t completely neglect 
them. Figure out what method of studying works for you, and be 
consistent. Being consistent will pay off in the long run, as opposed to 
studying everything at the last minute. College is all about balance, and try 
to find a schedule that works for you. Dualites, yes, your first-year CGPA 
matters a lot, but try to find time for yourself amid the rush for grades. 
Find some extracurricular activity you like, maybe a club or association 
that does work you like, and apply to them. There is a pressure of 
socializing and finding friends in college, and joining clubs, departments 
and associations will help you find your group. There are many people in 
college, and you’ll find the peer group you want.

SURVIVAL GUIDE
Remember to speak up for yourself if need be; your voice counts even if 
you are a fresher. It might be ironic, but you might feel lonely on a campus 
surrounded by thousands. Remember that your peers and seniors are 
always there to help you, no matter what. The issue might be academics, 
personal life, extra-curriculars, clubs, or anything else. It’s okay not to 
know everything, but keep learning and be kind to yourself and others. 
Soon, you’ll be using the word “lite” everywhere, and you’ll know what 
outlet to go to when you miss dinner and what ice cream you like the best 
on campus. Good luck, dear fresher, and we hope that you have a 
wonderful time at BITS. 


GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

LAN Cable - a suitable LAN cable is essential as not all hostel rooms get 
good wifi speeds.Q
Locks - you would need one lock for your almirah and one shared lock 
for your room. Keeping your rooms locked whenever you are not in 
them is a good habit.Q
Whiteboard marker and duster - the whiteboards in your room are 
beneficial tools for writing down formulae/discussing topics or 
questions with your friends; make good use of them.Q
Night Lamps - if you study late into the night, buy one so that you do 
not disturb your roommate’s sleep.Q
Calculator - Casio fx-991EX scientific calculator is the most popular.Q
Curtains - they are not provided with your rooms; you would require 
them if you enjoy privacy.Q
Laundry Bags - a necessity to carry clothes to CP or the weekly in-
hostel laundry.Q
Lab Coats - you require the blue one for workshop practice and the 
white one for chemistry and biology lab.Q
Extension Boards - you will have two sockets near your desk in the 
hostel, and you will need more.Q
Bucket and mug - during the winter, mainly if you are not used to cold 
showers (the showers do not have hot water), these are a must. Taps 
connected to the solar heater are separate.Q
Dustbin - for cleanliness.

Containers - to keep any snacks you might need during late study 
sessions.K
Mattresses - these are available for purchase when you reach the 
campus near your hostel. Remember to buy pillows, pillow covers and 
bed sheets too!K
Umbrella - obviously, you’ll need it for the rain and when summer rolls 
around the corner.

Other important things to have on campus/buy before coming to campus:

UPI - Almost every single vendor on campus accepts UPI, and the ATM 
on campus mainly gives out 500 rupee notes, so UPI is often less of a 
hassle, and it would be better if you have it
Facebook Account - There are many groups where you can interact with 
seniors and alumni, sell or buy items, and check for club and 
association announcements, among other things like travel; having a 
Facebook account is necessary to access these groups
SWD App - The All Night Canteen runs on the SWD App, where the 
advances you pay are used for food. Keep in mind, however, that if you 
go above the limit, you will have to pay the extra amount in the fees for 
the next semester
Splitwise - a great way to keep track of shared expenses for outings 
and everything else.

INTERACTIONS AND INTROS

While making friends on campus and meeting new people, you will also 
come across the seniors of BITS. This is how you will have to introduce 
yourself. Giving your introduction or “intro” is just a formality, and here is 
its general format.

Your Name
ID - 2024CCPSXXXXH
[CC - Branch Code, XXXX- Your unique four-digit number]
Your Hometown
Your hobbies and interests


Feel free to share your hometown, hobbies, and interests. This is a major 
conversation starter and a great way to bond. Your first few interactions 
might not go your way, depending on the type of seniors you have met. It 
is okay if you don’t connect with the senior talking to you, but never 
hesitate to participate in these interactions. All seniors take such 
interactions with genuine good intent, and the primary goal is to establish 
a meaningful dialogue and connection between you and your seniors. 
These seniors will be your guiding support throughout your college 
journey, offering insights into academics, clubs, internships, and advice on 
any issues you may face. 

However, if you ever find yourself not at ease or in discomfort during any 
interaction, you have the right to walk away and withdraw from the 
conversation, and no senior will stop you from doing this. If any senior 
overlooks your objection, persists, and troubles you, you can approach the 
Anti-Ragging Committee. Their contact information is listed below and 
again in the Important Contacts section of the Magazine.


BASICS OF BPHC ACADEMICS

Let's delve into the organizational structure and functioning of the 
academic system at BPHC.

COURSES 

At BPHC, courses replace subjects as primary educational units. These 
well-designed curricula cover various topics and comprise different 
evaluative components. The scope and intervals for topics and exams are 
largely left to the discretion of the I/C (Instructor in Charge) but the 
syllabus rarely sees a large shift from previous batches.

CREDITS

Each course is assigned a certain number of credits, indicating the effort 
required and its impact on your CGPA. In a semester, you must enroll in a 
minimum of 9 and a maximum of 25 credits. The total credits of all courses 
for a semester should fall within this range, and no exceptions are made in 
this regard.

PRACTICE SCHOOL

BITS provides you with an internship opportunity twice before the 
completion of your degree- Practice School-I (PS-I, worth 5 credits) and 
Practice School-II (PS-II, worth 20 credits). PS-I is a two month long 
summer internship that you are required to do after your 2 - 2. It requires 
a fee payment and you do not receive a stipend. On the other hand, PS-II is 
a semester-long paid internship that single degree students can choose to 
do in either semester of your last year, i.e. 4 - 1 or 4 - 2, and dual degree 
students have the option to do a dual PS instead of only one. The Practice 
School System allots you a PS Station on the basis of your CGPA, while 
taking your preferences into consideration.

VARIETIES OF COURSES

BITS offers three main types of courses:
1. Standard Courses: These are the most common and make up the 
majority of your coursework. They consist of three components;
a. Lectures: Here, you will learn the fundamental theory and concepts 
of the course. Usually, there are three lectures per week for 3 & 4 
credit courses. 2-credit courses generally have 1 or 2 lectures per 
week>
b. Tutorials: In tutorial classes, you solve problems related to the 
topics covered in lectures. These sessions have a smaller number of 
students per section but a larger number of sections scattered 
across several days of the week, allowing a convenient choice of 
slot and easy clarification of doubts. Typically, tutorials occur once 
a week.
c. Practical: Some courses (typically 4-credit courses) include a 
practical component. During practical sessions, you perform 
experiments relevant to the theory studied in lectures. These 
sessions can be enjoyable but are often evaluated.

2. Labs are typically 1-unit (sometimes 2 units) courses solely focused on 
conducting weekly experiments. They provide hands-on experience 
that complement the standard courses, despite lack of theoretical 
content>
3. Formal projects: These courses have a standard weightage of 3 credits, 
and are evaluated on the basis of a semester-long project undertaken 
with a professor. You need not worry about these until the end of 2nd 
year usually, but some people do apply for projects earlier. Informal 
projects do not contribute to your CGPA in any form.

To get a better understanding of how to prepare for individual first-year 
courses, the SWD portal has suggestions and advice.

CDCs

Core Disciplinary Courses are mandatory courses directly related to your 
chosen branch of study. Unlike other courses (electives), you cannot drop 
these from your semester schedule. Graduation will not be possible 
without obtaining a valid grade in these courses.


ELECTIVES AND MINORS

Now let's discuss some important aspects that may not be immediately 
relevant in your first year (as course selection is limited), but they hold 
great significance.

ELECTIVES: In addition to your CDCs, you have the option to take up courses 
falling under three categories:

1. Disciplinary Electives (DEl): These courses align with your branch and 
CDCs. It is recommended to take them from the 2-2 semester, although 
some ambitious students opt for them in their 2-1, meaning they'll 
study alongside third and fourth-year students (a challenging prospect). 
To graduate, you must complete a minimum of 4 disciplinary electives 
(12 credits). This allows you to explore your branch of study in domains 
of your preference instead of having to finish more CDCs:
2. Humanities Electives (HuEl): These courses are more diverse and 
enjoyable, attracting many students who are eager to pursue their 
passions. During the swap period, you may observe a rush as students 
try to secure these courses (and drop them just as fast during the drop 
period). To graduate, you need to complete a minimum of 3 humanities 
electives (8 credits). These courses often relate to social studies, 
literature, philosophies, cinematic arts, and social theory.
3. Open Electives (OpEl): These courses are open to anyone who meets the 
prerequisites. They provide an opportunity to explore subjects outside 
your core curriculum, potentially enabling you to pursue a minor or 
fulfill any unfulfilled Huel interests. You must complete a minimum of 5 
open electives (15 credits) to graduate.

PREREQUISITES: For certain courses, you must have already completed 
specific prerequisites to be eligible for enrollment. Planning is crucial, so 
consult the bulletin or seek advice from seniors to ensure you meet the 
requirements.

MINOR: By paying a nominal fee (though not insignificant by BITS 
standards), achieving the CGPA cutoff, and fulfilling the course 
requirements for the chosen minor, you can earn an additional degree. 
Planning your minor courses starting from your second year is 
recommended depending on your minor.


How do CGPA and grading work?

It’s pretty simple - really. The grading system works as follows:
“A”=10, “A-”=9, “B”=8, “B-”=7, “C”=6, “C-”=5, “D”=4, and “E”=2 grade points. 

You multiply the number of credits/units of a course with the points 
corresponding to the grade obtained; this resultant number makes up the 
grade points for that particular course. Take a summation of grade points 
across all courses in a semester and divide it by the total number of 
credits undertaken that semester; this gives your SGPA (Semester Grade 
Point Average). Do the same for all courses across all semesters and this 
results in your CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average).

For example, let's say you take 2 courses, Engineering Graphics (2 credits) 
and General Biology (3 credits) for the semester. In the end, you scored a 
B in Engineering Graphics and an A- in General Biology. 

Your SGPA will be:
(2 * 8(B)) + (3 * 9(A-)) / (2 + 3) = 8.6

Most courses usually give a B- or 7 at the average mark. Any grade other 
than the 8 valid grades mentioned above (such as an NC or RC) will 
require you to either repeat a course (in case of a CDC) or supplement 
those missed credits (in case of disciplinary electives, humanities 
electives, open electives).

IMPORTANT RESOURCES

College is going to be a lot different than school. It can often be stressful 
at times to gather notes, past year papers, etc. as half of the students 
don’t even attend classes. Here are a few links that can help you out (Use 
your BITS email ID in all of these links as they won’t work otherwise):

1. Impartus (https://a.impartus.com/)
Impartus is the video lecture storehouse of all the lectures (of the 
lecturers you are enrolled in during timetable registration). The video 
lecture will be uploaded within an hour after the completion of the 
lecture. So, in case you missed the lecture, you can watch it later and 
take down the notes. You can always use your friends’ credentials to 
log in and listen to other lecturers too. Impartus becomes a life savior 
during the mid-semester examinations and comprehensive examinations for many students. 
But, remember that Impartus works 
only in the lecture halls where there is a video recording facility and 
the lecturer has his/her mic turned on.

2. Course Management System (https://cms.bits-hyderabad.ac.in/)
CMS is an app designed by our BITS Hyderabad students for faculty to 
communicate with students. The faculty uploads all the lecture slides, 
tutorial problems, and mark lists, and shares information about 
changes in lecture venue, extra classes, evaluative timings and dates, 
etc. It is unanimously the most important app one has to have on the 
campus. (Note that some professors might opt for Google classroom 
as primary source of communication so make sure to pay attention to 
their announcements)

3. BPHC Digital Library (http://libraryopac.bits-hyderabad.ac.in/)
BPHC digital library is also available as an app. The digital library is 
the e-library of the campus wherein you can find all the e-books, 
research publications, catalogs, and previous year's papers in here 
along with a handful of e-resource links. You can also use it to know 
the book issue status.

4. Google-Drive Links (Students’ Union Drive first year and Acads Drive)
These links provide a plethora of previous year lectures, practice 
sheets, and useful resources for all your first-year courses, so make 
sure to get these from your seniors.

5. ERP Portal (https://erp.bits-pilani.ac.in/)
ERP portal is a platform where you can access your grade sheets, fee 
demands, course information, and personal information and also this 
is where you register for your courses for the semester. It is more like 
a visiting portal than a resource link for everyone on campus.

6. SWD App (https://swd.bits-hyderabad.ac.in/)
Student Welfare Division, or SWD, handles the non-academic aspects 
of campus life, this is the place where you'll participate in mess 
registration, purchase campus merchandise, and much more. SWD has 
a dedicated room in the C-block, and its very own app. The student 
body of the SWD is called the nucleus. For any queries and issues 
regarding campus life, you can approach the student representatives 
of the SWD using the following link.

7. Handouts for you (https://handoutsforyou.vercel.app)
This website is a database where you can find all information about 
our campus academics, from course handouts to placement records.

8. Chronofactorem (www.chrono.crux-bphc.com)
A mock scheduling website made by our very own coding club, this is a 
website where you experiment with the placement of lecture hours 
throughout your week and try to come up with the best schedule for 
your semester. This application is mostly used before the semester 
begins to create mock timetables.

9. Good Old Books
Yep, you’re gonna need these for practice and open-book exams. You 
do have an option to buy new books from the Book Syndicate, but it’s 
wise to buy older ones from your seniors, as you might not want to see 
the books after you’re done with them. The old books will be on sale 
on WhatsApp groups or on the BPHC Buy & Sell facebook group at the 
start of semester, usually at prices lower than new ones. Make sure to 
check prices of the new books before you approach your seniors as 
there's a tiny chance you’ll be charged higher.

FINANCIAL AID OFFERED AT BITS
Despite the exorbitant fees that BITS charges you per semester (3-3.5L), 
it also offers you ways to lower the financial burden, which is how most 
students at BITS study despite their financial backgrounds.

You can opt for financial aid in three ways: Loans, Scholarships and SAF.

LOANS

There is an SBI bank right here on campus, where you can apply for loans 
and manage your bank account if you cannot pay your fee for the 
semester. The process varies from person to person, so we’ll give some 
key points that can help:
1. For the loan application, the bank employees will guide you through 
the loan process, so take it easy. If you don’t have a bank account yet, 
you can create one there.
2. If you’re a minor, you’ll be given a bank account, but you’re not 
allowed online banking. So you can only deposit or withdraw cash 
from your bank account, which you can do at the ATM just next to the 
bank.
3. BITS is classified by SBI as an A institution, hence the upper limit for 
loan is 40 lakh without collateral security. The interest rate floats 
around 8-9%. It is simple interest for the duration of your degree + 1 
year, and then compounded for 15 years.

Contact the SBI branch on campus for more information regarding loans.

SCHOLARSHIPS
The college also offers you a chance to lift some of your financial 
burden through your academic performance, yes - the almighty CGPA. 
The scholarships, however, are applicable only on your tuition fee 
(mind you, you still gotta pay your hostel and mess fee alongside some 
other miscellaneous fees)

1. Merit Scholarship
As the name suggests, the students with high academic 
performance (which will be represented by their rank in the batch 
and CGPA) will be offered a scholarship regardless of their income 
status or their branch.  Students need not apply for this scholarship 
and will be automatically awarded.

2. Merit-cum-Need Scholarship (MCN)
The MCN scholarship takes your parents’ total annual income into 
consideration. That is, if your parents earn a total income less than 
the amount set by the college (it was around 12 LPA last year). You 
need to apply for this scholarship when the notification arrives in 
the SWD portal so keep on a eye on it. The documents required will 
be mentioned in the notification.

For a general idea of the merit scholarship, the cut-off for receiving a 
100% fee waiver was around 9.8 CGPA, and for a 40% scholarship was 
around 9.5 CGPA. These cutoffs, although very harsh on students who 
can score to the lower margin and miss, represent the college’s 
emphasis on merit and consistency.

STUDENT AID FUND (SAF)

This fund aims to provide assistance to talented students whose 
families cannot provide for their education without financial 
assistance. This is an annual scholarship unlike the Merit and MCN 
scholarships and the amount of scholarship varies from student to 
student, based on academic performance and financial circumstances.

The notification for this too will be released on the SWD portal and the 
required documents are almost the same as those required for MCN.

THE ACADEMIC BLOCK

Most of your lectures will be in the F block, mainly F102, F103 (on the right 
side of the amphitheatre) or F104, F105 (which is on the left side). You will 
encounter F106 on the left before you reach the amphitheatre. You may 
also have a few lectures in F108 or F107, which you walk past when you 
enter through the D block entrance and go straight ahead to the F block. 
Your labs for engineering graphics and computer programming are also 
easily accessed through the D block entrance. (You’ll have your computer 
programming labs in the D-block and I-block, but your lab exam will 
probably be in the D block). The library lawns have the lecture halls on one 
side, opposite to the library. The other two sides are the auditorium and 
the stage. Many tutorial classes will be held in the G block, which is where  
the library is. Your Chemistry lab will be in the B block, while your Physics 
and Biology labs will be in the A block on the first and ground floors 
respectively. Some courses will also have tutorial classes in the new 
academic block, often shortened to NAB, which is located behind the 
auditorium. 

The iconic large chessboard is in the middle of the H, I, J, and K blocks, 
together known as the NAB (in an anticlockwise order from the H block, 
which is located directly ahead of the G block). To the left of the F block, 
you’ll find the Workshop, which is where you’ll have your Workshop 
Practices course, as well as some electronics labs for your seniors. The 
Auditorium is where all major events happen, such as comedy nights, 
music and dance performances, orientations, movie screenings by RAF,  
general body meetings (GBMs), and other official stuff. It has seats aplenty, 
is air-conditioned, and has multiple entryways. There are two eateries in 
the Academic block; Isthara, the main food court, and a Cafe Coffee Day 
outlet, serving fresh food, tea, coffee and other refreshments. Directly 
opposite the auditorium, across the library lawns, is the C block, more on 
that below.

LIBRARY 

In the acad block, between G103 and G104, you’ll find the library. A haven 
for readers, as well as for those who want to study in peace and quiet, the 
library consists of two floors, and a few sections which we’ll get to. As you 
enter the library you have to keep your bags and other belongings in 
storage rooms, but you’re allowed to take laptops, books, stationery and 
chargers as you require. To your left you’ll find facilities like washrooms, 
drinking water, as well as a stationery where you can buy what you need 
and get printouts of material. Further ahead you’ll find the Reference 
sections on your left and right, where you can use reference books and 
textbooks to help with your academics (although keep in mind that you’re 
not allowed to issue them), and as you proceed you’ll find a large hall with 
circular tables flanking either side, as well as bean bags for your leisure. 
Further yet is the Reading section, a large area with numerous tables that 
seat four, as well as racks of books both academic and not. To the right are 
separate cubicles for those who enjoy studying in solitude. The upper 
floor of the library is a huge hall which has cubicles, tables for four, as well 
as tables for larger parties who want to study as a group. The library opens 
at 9 am, and usually stays open till 11 pm on weekdays, with the timings 
being a bit different on the weekends. These timings get extended to later 
in the night during the mid-semester and comprehensive exams. The 
library is air-conditioned, and has charging ports for when your devices 
run low. Happy studying!



C BLOCK (Important) 

AUGSD: The Academic-Undergraduate Studies Division manages every 
aspect of your educational journey – from arranging classes and allotting 
instructors to the anxiety-inducing moment of grade releases. Should you 
ever seek guidance or need to voice concerns about your academics, they 
are just a hop skip and jump away.

SWD: The Student Welfare Division handles the non-academic part of your 
stay on campus. They play a crucial role in processing financial assistance 
claims and diligently collect your fees. Additionally, they are responsible 
for managing hostel and mess allotment, ensuring you have a place to call 
home during your time here.

Timetable Division (TTD): As the name suggests, the Timetable Division 
takes charge of your schedule on campus. They expertly arrange the 
timing and locations for lectures, tutorials, and practicals. When you need 
to book a room within the academic block, they are the ones to approach.

Practice School Division: This division deals with PS-1 and 2. It approaches 
various companies so that opportunities can be provided to the students. 
The companies are then properly listed and each student gets to select 
one based on their needs and interests.

MEDICAL CENTRE

The Medical Centre (often simply called MedC), located near CP, serves as 
the campus’s main destination for all your medical needs. Housing 
personnel of various specialisations, the MedC is where you go to get your 
medical woes resolved. They have a couple of ambulances to respond to 
emergencies on campus, as well as to transport patients to centres within 
the city should it be needed. All medical personnel may not be available 
whenever, but their presence (or lack thereof) will be intimated via email. 
Should you require a make-up for a lab or an evaluation due to medical 
reasons, the MedC is where you go, where the qualified authorities will 
write you a form that will serve as proof for you to send mails to the 
concerned faculty.

HOSTELS

There are three main first-year hostels on campus: Valmiki, Gautam, and 
Malviya. The first two are boys’ hostels and the third is the girls’ hostel, 
though not exclusively for first years. Valmiki is on the side of the OFG 
(check miscellaneous) closer to the gate, while the other two are close to 
the SAC. They all have sand volleyball/badminton courts in their center 
and vending machines for a quick snack. 

When you move in, your room comes equipped with necessities: A bed, 
table, a whiteboard and a cupboard. (The mattress for the bed will have to 
be bought separately) You can access the internet through the LAN port in 
your room; this also gives you access to DC++. (Check our guide for specific 
instructions)

MESS

There are two main dining halls (mostly called messes) on our campus, 
aptly named messes 1 and 2, on opposite sides of the hockey field. Their 
allocation is done every month, through the mess registration on the SWD 
website. Of these, Mess 1 is generally more sought after, with open seats in 
the mess sometimes unavailable in two to three minutes. A possible 
reason for this could be that Mess 1 has a kind of bustle about it, while 
Mess 2 has a calmer atmosphere. Food-wise, each mess has its strong 
points and weak ones. They are the breeding ground of friendships, where 
friends all gather around a table, occasionally testing the physical limits of 
space.

Usually, as the semester progresses, students, tired of the monotony, end 
up buying food from the shops inside the mess using the SWD website or 
from the outlets in front of each mess. On special occasions, the caterers 
of each mess provide a better variety of food, one that doesn’t make you 
question every life decision you’ve made. For students that need a second 
(or a better) dinner, the saviour that is the ANC (All Night Canteen) 
provides from 10 PM to 2 AM. In exam season, it comes in clutch for the 
weary souls- those who couldn't find the strength to make it to the mess 
during the day.

CP

Our campus has a hub where you can get pretty much anything and 
everything you’ll need. Called CP, short for Connaught Place (ring a bell, 
Delhi people?), ours might not be as big or grand, but it sure provides you 
with every necessity you may have as a student here on campus. Let’s take 
a closer look at some of the shops, shall we?

1. Fruitful: This spot offers fresh juices, delicious brownies, rolls, tea, 
french fries, and more. There are omelets, boiled eggs, paneer, and 
other high-protein stuff that you as a gym goer will need.>
2. Book Syndicate: The only bookstore on campus. While it's often wiser 
to buy books from seniors, if you need new books, you can find them 
here with some discount\
3. Karuturi: A stationery shop that stocks everything you need for 
academics and beyond. It's a go-to place, especially during open-book 
exams\
4. Hair Salon: A decent salon offering all basic facilities for grooming\
5. Gift Shop: Despite its small size, this shop offers a wide variety of 
items, including sports goods, mugs, gift wrappers, and more\
6. Fruit & Vegetable Shop: A reliable spot for fresh fruits and vegetables 
at reasonable rates, comparable to big online platforms\
7. SBI bank- SBI Bank on our college campus offers a range of services, 
including account opening and study loans. With an SBI ATM on-site, 
cash withdrawals are convenient\
8. Pharmacy: This is the place to go for any required medication, and yes, 
sometimes, dealing with academic stress might require some 
paracetamol.
9. Laundry Shops: For those who prefer not to wash clothes on their own, 
these places are favorites. Though the rates are decent, be cautious 
about clothes getting misplaced. There are two of them that remain 
closed on different days, so you can give your clothes in either<
10. Agarwal General Store: As the name suggests, this store offers all your 
general grocery needs, from buckets and mugs to instant noodles and 
chips. (editor's note: do we mention the 5% discount on most things?)
11.  Heritage Stationery Shop: Similar to Karuturi, you can get printouts 
and all kinds of stationery here. Additionally, there's a DTDC courier 
service available<
12. Gift Shop (another one): In addition to gifts, this shop stocks LAN 
cables, buckets, and more. Inside the shop, there's also a ladies' parlor 
offering services like threading and haircutting<
13. Tea Time: An outlet where you get freshly cut fruits and fruit juices, as 
well as many kinds of tea, coffee and milkshakes, with biscuits and 
other snacks to go with them. 

Additionally, most parcels you order online will be delivered in CP (near 
one of the entrances, close to SBI and the medical store). If not here, you’ll 
find them near Mess 1. The delivery partner will contact you when they’re 
there, so you can collect your parcel from them, or send a friend to collect 
it for you if you’re busy. 

Our CP might not have the grandeur of Delhi's Connaught Place, but it's a 
convenient and essential part of college life, catering to the diverse needs 
of students and making our daily routines a little easier

FOOD OUTLETS

Oh, this is the fun part. Sometimes you’re really REALLY just done with 
mess food, and craving something a little more appealing to your taste 
buds. Or maybe you’re just looking for a cup of coffee to help you get 
through gruelling all nighters. Whatever your need, the food outlets on 
campus are sure to provide you with whatever you’re craving. Here’s a 
brief intro to most of the food outlets:

1. Nescafe: An outlet where you get both hot and cold beverages like 
tea, iced tea, and various kinds of coffee, along with some food 
items too. There’s one in the lawns in front of Vishwakarma hostel, 
and another one in NABe
2. Isthara: The food court in the academic block. You can get 
breakfast, lunch and snacks from the food court, fresh fruit juices, 
delectable frankies, and hot tea and filter coffee.Q
3. Cafe Coffee Day: Another option for getting your caffeine in while 
in the acad block. You can get freshly brewed coffee for cheap, as 
well as some items like cookies, sandwiches, juices and chips.Q
4. Wich Please: An outlet that serves exactly what’s advertised. 
Sandwiches. It is an entirely vegetarian stall and serves till late at 
night. The dishes are fairly priced. The costlier triple layered 
sandwiches are worth the cost. You also get sweet dessert 
sandwiches and a few kinds of Maggie
5. Hotspot: We can’t mention Maggi without mentioning Hotspot, can 
we? Many, MANY kinds of Maggi are available here, as well as 
sandwiches, momos, omelettes, biryani (yes, the actual one), rolls, 
chicken tikka, the list goes on. You can also get coffee and tea for 
when you need some caffeine in your bloodstreame
6. SFC: The campus’s resident burger spot. You can get mouth-
watering burgers, as well as other fried snacks like nuggets and 
the like. You can also get Red Bull here (for when Sting doesn’t do 
the trick). 
7. Yummpy’s: The oldest, cheapest, and a crowd favourite, 
Yummpy’s is a go-to place for tons of bored-of-mess-food 
students. They have a short menu, serving noodles, sandwiches, 
(not precisely) biryani and rice bowls that give you a break from 
the mess food you will get used to1
8. Thickshake: For all the milkshake and ice cream lovers, here’s 
your haven. Get normal milkshakes and thickshakes, scoops of 
ice cream, as well as other snacks1
9. Amul:  It’s an Amul parlour. They serve ice-creams, drinks, and 
chocolates. EXTREMELY busy during summertime, when this place 
basically becomes a necessity to visit1
10. Vijay Vahini: An outlet that serves a variety of curries and starters 
to eat with rotis and parathas, as well as rice and noodle options. 
They serve both North and South Indian dishes. It is a go-to 
option for homely meals and friend group dinners1
11. Fruitful: An outlet in CP that offers burgers, momos, shakes, 
cookies, cakes, and other stuff. Most notably, it sells food high in 
protein like omelettes, boiled eggs and paneer, which – along 
with its proximity to the gym – makes it the perfect choice for 
gymgoers. They have reasonable prices, and very cordial owners 
and staff, but their only problem is their inconsistency with 
opening dates and timings1
12. BITSian Pleasant: A fine dining restaurant mostly for parties. They 
serve soups, oriental and north Indian entrées, main course, 
delectable kebabs, biryani, and more. The decor is pleasant to 
watch. One can purchase sodas from the refrigerator next to the 
cashier. A bit pricey to say the least, but the more people you 
need to feed, the better.'

SAC AND SPORTS

The campus has plenty of facilities for all the sports lovers out there, 
there’s something for everyone so there’s no need to worry.

1. Hockey Field: A big field that separates the two messes. No one calls it 
Hockey Field, though; it’s mostly called OFG (Old Football Ground) 
because it used to be the old football ground (who would’ve thought)
2. Kabaddi Ground: There’s a kabaddi field near OFG, where some of the 
most high-octane matches happen during sports fests
3. Volleyball Courts: There are two volleyball courts within a metal cage 
so the ball doesn’t go out of bounds, it’s well-lit by floodlights too.

As you go along, you’ll find CP, and beyond it, there are a couple more 
sports grounds, as well as the famous Student Activity Centre (SAC)

4. Tennis Courts: There are two tennis courts where team players and 
casuals can practice their game
5. Basketball: Two courts with a marked three-point line, equipped with 
floodlights and a seating area commonly known as the ‘bleachers.’ 
Know this place like the back of your hand as this is where most first-
time interactions occur. Watch out for the inductions!
6. Football and Athletics: Right past the basketball court, there is a large 
football field that is circled by a 400m track, called the New Football 
Ground (NFG). Both athletics and football events occur here.
7. Swimming: A recently opened facility, the swimming pool is a 
recreational area with a pool that is 25m long and 1.5m deep. Timings 
are strict and so is the swimwear allowed.?

8. Cricket: A little further beyond NFG and the swimming pool, you’ll find 
the cricket grounds.

Soon you’ll spot the big beautiful building in all its glory, the Student 
Activity Centre. It’s the hub of all major recreational activities, and has two 
floors with the following facilities:

On the lower floor, you’ll find
1. Three pool tables and one billiard table along with the necessary 
equipments.
2. A punching bag where you could catch your peers venting out for all 
the misfortunes they face.
3. A dance room where you might catch a few dancers from Swaranjali 
preparing for the next fest.

4. Further in, a squash room. Bring your equipment.
5. Two badminton courts along with plenty of walking room along the 
sides. Usually the most in-demand sport on campus as it is rarely 
empty. Bring your equipment.
6. The gym has two floors. Weights (lower floor) and cardio/plyometrics 
(upper floor) Both sections of the gym are well equipped with 
machines and weights and the only requirement is to wear proper gear 
and maintain hygiene.

As for the upper floor, it’s where most clubs and departments hold their 
meetings, rehearsals, and game nights. Notable places include the ELAS, 
VFX, music, chess, carrom, photography, dramatics and Arts and deco 
rooms. A common hangout spot on the first floor is the balcony - a place 
where you may find the occasional musician or people from ELAS or Arts 
and Deco. This balcony overlooks RNT with a nice view of nature below. Be 
careful while walking on the upper floors, though. Nobody wants to tip 
over that random can of paint!

The SAC also houses the Tinkerer’s Lab, one can find this student bunker 
under a staircase between the football grounds and the basketball courts. 
It’s a place usually occupied by members of ARC/Aeolus and is the 
workspace of some of the brightest minds on campus.

FESTS

PEARL

The cultural fest of BPHC, which grew into a national-level college cultural 
fest with participation from more than 50 colleges across India is usually 
the last official fest of the academic year. Color, joy, and vigor usually 
infest the air during this time. Pearl has hosted many celebrities of 
vernacular, national, and international renown over the years since its 
inception. Each of the three days of the festival ends with a performance 
by a celebrity performer or band. Make sure to join the fun with your clubs 
as well, to get a hands-on experience and unique perspective! Members of 
cultural clubs also get the opportunity to perform on opening night in 
front of a roaring home crowd in our auditorium. 


ATMOS

Atmos (Assimilation of Technically MOtivated Souls), the first fest every 
fresher would experience, is generally held in October. This fest gives you 
a chance to channel the technical genius in you. ATMOS hosts a myriad of 
inter-college technology and management-related competitions and group 
discussions, where students from across the nation battle to ace. These 
competitions cover various fields of interest, attracting many participants 
and a large audience, the most prominent ones being Robowars and Drone 
racing events. Apart from this, numerous open workshops are conducted 
to help students explore new avenues. ATMOS is also a platform where 
prominent leaders from various sectors are invited to conduct talks. The 
three days of ATMOS are bound to make memories for life.

ARENA

Arena, BPHC’s annual inter-college sports fest is the most energetic and 
power-packed fest, organized in January, a super exciting month, with 3 
more exciting days for Verba Maximus. It’s a fest where one can enjoy, both 
inside the court as a player or outside it, and witness thrilling matches 
that very often leave you speculating till the very last minute. ARENA sets 
up a unique atmosphere on the campus, with students from different 
colleges exploring it, floodlights livening up the night, a ton of food stalls 
set up and people gathering close to keep a watch on the scoreboards. A 
place where players bond over games and skills are chiseled, ARENA is one 
of the fests that attracts a lot of footfall.


VERBA MAXIMUS

Verba Maximus is the unofficial literary fest of BPHC. Members of ELAS and 
JC, this is your time to shine! Unlike other fests, there are no holidays while 
this fest is being organized, though you will still see food trucks and a long 
line for coupons in front of either mess. Events include both speaking and 
writing contests and for those members who get to work behind the 
scenes, the lack of stressful work combined with a lot of goofing around, 
this patch of spring will rejuvenate your mind for the upcoming exam 
season.


LAUNCHPAD

Launchpad is the annual entrepreneurship summit conducted by E-Cell of 
BPHC. It is an event filled with internship opportunities, events, exciting 
workshops, and many young entrepreneurs pitching their innovative ideas. 
This time ‘Pitcher's Pilot’ was also organized, an event inspired by 
SharkTank, which was a bliss to the eyes.



TRAVEL
In the course of a few weeks, the magnificent campus of 200 acres will 
start to feel small and less fun to you, and you will want to go out in the 
city to have a blast. However, our campus is on the far outskirts of the city, 
so much so that just the name of our college is enough of an excuse for 
cab drivers to cancel the rides. However, there is no need to worry as the 
following will guide you through both your pre-planned and last-minute 
outing plans with your friends.

One thing you all should understand is in college life at BITS Hyderabad, 
your best friend is no person but bus no. 212. It is the only bus that comes 
to the campus gate and travels to Secunderabad railway station. It makes 
your travel easier and cheaper, with just 35 rupees you will be able to 
reach the nearest metro station, i.e. the Parade Ground metro station, from 
where you can reach any corner of the city.  Timings for 212 are usually 
updated on the Free Expression Group (FEG) Facebook group.

In case you ever miss 212, because of your ever so punctual friends, there 
is no need to worry as you can take any of the other buses that go to 
Parade Ground, from the bus station near Thumkunta/Tandoor restaurant. 
There are plenty of rickshaws available in front of the gate that will take 
you to Thumkunta for a fixed price of 100 rupees, for 5 people or less; if 
the number of passengers exceeds 5, then the price becomes 20 per 
person. On a side note, it is very much advised to save the contacts of 
these rickshaw-walas because if you are anywhere near the campus or 
somewhere between the campus and Alwal, they come to pick you up if 
you call them. Coming back to the buses to Parade Ground, there is a bus 
stop in front of Tandoor restaurant where buses come every 10 minutes. 
Ask the driver if the bus goes to Parade Ground and gets in, you will most 
probably be standing as the buses are quite full. In short, the crucial part 
of your travel, i.e. to reach Parade Ground will take you 40-60 mins and 60 
rupees at max.

Try to carry cash, as UPI might not always be available here.

Once you reach Parade Ground, all you gotta do is put in the place you 
wanna go to on Google Maps and check the nearest metro station from 
that place. Book a metro ticket to that place, which can be easily done via 
Paytm: all you gotta do is scan the QR codes present near every metro 
station ticket counter. A metro ticket costs between 10-60 rupees 
depending on where you want to go. Hyderabad metro has 3 lines, red, 
blue, and green. Using the map of the metro routes, just check whether 
you have to change lines at whichever junction. The journey in the metro 
will usually not take you any longer than 30 minutes, depending on where 
you are going. After reaching the desired station, you can easily find 
rickshaws lined outside the metro station. However, it is convenient and 
easier to book an OLA or Uber rickshaw, if you are bad at negotiating the 
fare. 

To be honest, coming back to campus is one of the most hectic and 
cumbersome tasks. After 10:15 pm the metro closes, and after 9 pm cab 
drivers use their upper hand. Even if you book by Ola/Uber or any other 
app, the cab driver will call you and ask what is the destination, and if you 
say BITS Pilani, they will either do one of three things– Cancel the ride, say 
that they are coming and then cancel the ride, or outright ask for extra 
money than what the app says (and they might STILL cancel the ride). To 
tackle the first 2 scenarios; you don’t say BITS Pilani directly, but say 
Shamirpet. In response, they’ll still have the same reason that they won’t 
get a ride back, but at least in this case they might come and be willing to 
think of the third scenario. As harsh as it may sound, you will have no 
choice but to pay a little more than what the app says, otherwise, no cab 
driver will take your ride. 100-200 rupees works, but not more than that. 

To save yourself from all this trouble, try not to stay out too late, as buses 
still run from JBS to Tandoor, or Thumkunta till 8. So that’s your best and 
cheapest option.

Finally! You have been successful in going out with your friends. Keep 
practicing and who knows one day your Goa plan may come true as well.

TRAVEL OUTSIDE CAMPUS - OUTSTATION [AIRPORT AND RAILWAY STATION]
To go home and come back to Hyderabad, the options most students use 
are air and rail. So to get from the airport and multiple railway stations, 
the cab drivers charge exorbitant fares since our campus is fairly far from 
the city center. A ride to the airport will set you back about 1600 to 1800 
rupees for a cab, and the fares for Secunderabad or Nampally stations will 
cost you about 1000 rupees.

To leave campus, you can either book a cab from the multiple agencies 
who ply to campus or if you’re lucky enough, you may even find an Ola or 
Uber driver nearby. When coming to campus, as mentioned before, they’ll 
probably ask for extra money due to reasons. Do not let them scalp you 
out of a lot of money in the name of ORR toll. Always agree on the price 
and route of your commute and never give more than 100-200 rupees 
extra if your haggling fails. 

Hence, we also have a few groups to make your commute to the airport 
and railway stations easier in your pocket by sharing cabs and splitting 
the cost. Our Facebook group Travel@BPHC, and a new app named 
Rideshare BPHC (by the campus dev group CRUx) will help you find people 
going at the time and date of your travel plan.  

BITS LINGO

Lite
It’s a way of life here at Bits, a façade to hide away all your inner pain and 
to delulu your way away from CG. It means that the issue is “light” or 
doesn’t matter which isn’t always the case. “How did the quiz go?” “Lite, 
bro.” “How’s your sem CG?” “Lite, bro.”

Tuts
It stands for tutorial classes where you solve problems. Some tuts like EG 
are evaluative, but most aren’t. 

Ghots
Someone still stuck in their JEE phase who studies all the time. It becomes 
impossible to have a normal conversation with them without talking about 
academics. But it’s more of a praise than an insult.

Verti 
The dream that remains a dream for most freshers. It is the chance to get 
upgraded to a better branch awarded to the highly meritorious.

PHoEnix (Perpetual Hankerers of Electronix)
A term used to collectively refer to all EEE, ECE, and ENI students. A dualite 
is fuelled by the fear of ending up in the highly dreaded phoenix. The 
stressful evals, the heavy workload, and the pressure among students will 
ensure you come out of BITS electrocuted.

BST
It stands for BITSian standard time. It varies from IST by a minimum of 30 
minutes. So every event you attend- inauguration, artist’s pro shows, 
comedy nights, and cultural nights, expect it to be delayed by 30 minutes 
at least.

ERP
The site handles registration for courses, and fee payment, and displays 
your grades (if it loads up that is). 

ANC
It stands for ‘All Night Canteen’. You make orders on SWDPay on the SWD 
app/website and it is the place to satisfy your midnight cravings. Money is 
spent like it's free here till the deductions sheet comes out. It is one of the 
best things that our campus has to offer, make the most of it.

DISCO
You wouldn’t want to be anywhere associated with this. It stands for the 
Disciplinary Committee. (it's also the short form for Discrete Structures in 
Computer Science, a 2-1 CDC)

ROCKS
A large collection of you guessed it: huge rocks. You must have seen this 
by now. The piece of architecture that stands out in our campus. Climbing 
the rocks is a fun activity for friends and couples alike.

LL and RNT (refer to map)
LL, running from the main gate to Vishwakarma Bhawan, stands for Lover’s 
Lane but contradictory to its name it’s isolated. RNT refers to Road Not 
Taken, and it's the stretch of road going from SAC to New Academic Block.

Makeup 
If you miss an evaluative, you can redeem yourself with makeup. General 
advice- take it only for labs and don’t miss any exams. The makeup papers 
are way harder than the regular ones and you don’t know if you’d even be 
granted one.

Interaction
When a senior asks you for one, or to give an “intro”, you follow the 
format- name, ID number, where you are from, and your hobbies. It may or 
may not be accompanied by a task. It is always fun and opens you up.

DC++
That LAN cable of yours isn’t just good for providing high-speed 
internet, you know. Enter DC++, a software that allows peer-to-peer 
sharing of files over the LAN. The campus WiFi has some restrictions 
and a 10GB data limit, which can be frustrating if you want to 
download or upload multiple files. That’s where DC++ comes in. It 
allows you to connect to other users connected to the LAN, share files 
with them, and access files that they share. The files shared include 
terabytes of games, movie shows, movies, and music on the 
entertainment side, as well as videos, slides, courses, and other 
material on the academic side. With DC++, you can download and 
upload files freely without limits.
