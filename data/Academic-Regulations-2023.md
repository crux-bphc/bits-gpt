ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 
1. General 
The educational programmes of the Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani 
(BITS Pilani), hereinafter referred as the Institute are conducted on-campus at any of its 
campuses as well as off-campus at various collaborating organisations. The programmes for 
which instructions, except Practice School/Thesis/Seminar/ Dissertation, are given on-
campus at Pilani, Dubai, Goa or Hyderabad are classified as “on-campus” programmes. The 
“off-campus” programmes are either structured collaborative programmes conducted at 
collaborating organisations or are work integrated learning programmes without structured 
collaborative programmes. These regulations govern “on-campus” as well as “off-campus 
work integrated learning and collaborative” programmes (hereafter referred to as “off-
campus” programmes), unless specifically stated otherwise. 
1.00 
Every academic year shall be divided into two regular semesters known as the first 
semester and the second semester. The maximum number of units, a first degree student 
can register is twenty-five, a higher degree student can register is twenty, excluding 
deficiency/Audit course(s). [for unit see Section 1.05]. Number of deficiency/Audit 
course(s) for a higher degree student may not exceed 2 in a semester. For certain higher 
degree programmes the maximum units/semester can slightly differ. For example, a 
student of MBA in Business Analytics programme can register twenty one units in a 
semester.  
1.01 
The programme of studies leading to a degree consists of prescribed courses 
sequentially distributed over the required number of semesters. Whenever summer 
months are used, either for academic or for administrative purposes, recourse is always 
to be taken through what is known as Summer Term. 
1.02 
Summer term normally consists of eight weeks, provides for a special accelerated 
pace and requires that the number of courses in which any student is permitted to register 
cannot be more than three (subject to availability), provided the total number of units is 
not more than 10 unless the semester wise pattern differs. Nevertheless, certain courses 
like Practice School II, Thesis/Seminar, and Dissertation in the first and second tiers, and 
other courses specifically so mentioned in the Bulletin cannot, by their very nature, be 
offered as a single entity in an accelerated pace during the summer term. However, a 
student who has already completed his/her entire normal duration of the programme and 
is left with only the First Degree Thesis as a backlog and eligible for graduation after the 
completion of 9 units of thesis, then he/she may be offered the 9 units thesis during the 
summer term as an exceptional case subject to the recommendation of the Departmental 
Committee on Academics (DCA) and approval by the Dean, AUGS. Please see Clause 
6.16(d) for graduation requirements. Also, refer Clause 7.05 for further details about the 
summer term. 
1.03 
While each programme has a normal duration indicated either in the Institute 
Bulletin or prescribed by an appropriate authority, the eligibility for a degree is always 
determined on the basis of number of courses and units completed. While the 
regulations stipulate certain minimum number of units for each programme, for actual 
requirement of any programme the Bulletin/appropriate committee has to be consulted. 
The minimum stipulated number of units for various degree programmes are given 
below: 
 
1.04

40 
M.Tech./MBA (Off-Campus Programmes) 
64 
M.Sc. (Off-Campus Programmes) (for normal input of 3 year 
Undergraduate degree) 
72 
 
The stipulated minimum number of units for Post Graduate Diploma (Off Campus) 
is 28 units. 
1.04a 
A unit (Academic credits) is a convenient device to anticipate the number of hours 
per week of total effort including the class work of a student, as the system recognises only 
the formal contact hours in the class room and laboratory as a means for sustained self-
study. While the structuring of the courses in terms of classroom hours, lab. hours etc. is 
done through the timetable each semester/term, the total hours of work for each unit is 
approximately three hours per week. In the case of Ph.D. thesis, whatever may be the 
number of units for which a student registers, the student has to devote all the available 
time for the thesis work. The semester wise programme consists of a prescribed set of 
courses described in the Bulletin, adding to a certain total number of units in each semester, 
for an anticipated normal progress through the programme. This number is called the 
normal load for that semester for that programme. Normal load is a mere reference point 
for construction of a programme and would carry no other significance in these 
regulations. 
1.05 
The academic objectives of a programme require a proper sequencing of not only 
individual courses but also of a cluster of courses. For each programme, the Semester wise 
pattern presented in the Bulletin conveys a sense of what comes first and what comes 
later. Nonetheless particular attention is required in respect of local points of monitoring; 
namely: (a) prerequisite of an individual course (see 3.13) and (b) the prior preparation 
before registering in an individual course or a group of courses (see 3.14 & 3.15). 
1.06 
These regulations demand of the system certain operations which have to take place 
during pendency of a student's progress through the programme. These are: monitoring 
the pace of his/her progress (see 5.02), amendment/revision of the original registration in 
each semester (see 3.26 & 3.27), registration of students who depart from the normal pace 
(see 3.25), etc. These can be done only with reference to a ‘prescribed programme’. The 
prescribed programme is defined as the whole series of courses required of students that 
unfold as a package of courses in the requisite number of semesters. The prescribed 
semester courses are those courses which appear in each of the above unfolding of 
successive semesters. 
1.07 
Whenever these regulations and the Bulletin provide for policies, regulations, or 
operations governing the programmes to be worked out, an Academic Governing 
Committee (AGC) will work out the same within the broad guidelines given. The 
Academic Governing Committee will consist of Dean, Academic-Under Graduate Studies 
(AUGS), Dean, Academic- Graduate Studies and Research (AGSR), Dean, Practice 
School (PS), Dean, Work Integrated Learning Programmes (WILP), Associate Dean, 
AUGS from each campus, Associate Dean, AGSR from each campus and Professor-in-
1.08 
 
3 
charge, BITS Entrance Examinations. The Convenorship of the Committee will rotate 
amongst these members depending on the item to be discussed. The Committee may form 
sub-committees to address specific academic matters either as standing committees or on 
an ad-hoc basis. The Committee may also co-opt any other member of the faculty for 
discussion on any particular topic. Generally the details to be worked out would be related 
to admission with advance standing, admission with marginal deficiency, dual degree 
programmes, transfer operations etc. 
All academic matters regarding - first degree or higher degree programmes 
including the curriculum, listing or categorization of courses, pre-requisites of courses, 
are to be worked out by the cross-campus Departmental Committee on Academics 
(ccDCA) of the respective Department(s). They may approach the Dean AUGS / Dean 
AGSR/Dean WILP for approval by the Senate. All other operational matters regarding 
a student’s access to certain courses, exemptions/deviation from a student’s prescribed 
path to graduation, etc. may be worked out by the Departmental Committee on 
Academics (DCA) of the respective Department. To resolve any inter departmental or 
institute level issues, the proposal submitted by ccDCA may be referred to Academic 
Governing Committee (AGC) through Dean AUGS / Dean AGSR/Dean WILP before 
submitting it to the Senate for approval.  
1.08a 
A committee known as the Doctoral Counselling Committee (DCC), will look 
after the academic/operational details and also perform certain specific function in 
respect of Ph.D. students. The committee will consist of Dean, AGSR (Convener), 
Dean, Sponsored Research and Consulting, Dean, AUGS, Associate Deans AGSR of 
each campus, one faculty member from each campus to be nominated by the Senate for 
a period of two years. 
1.08b 
For the anticipated normal population, the prescribed programme is the semester-
wise pattern as described in the Bulletin. For various categories of students who use the 
flexibilities of the system (see section 7) the prescribed programme is given to him/her 
at the time of commencement of the flexibility. For students who are permitted by these 
regulations to follow a pace other than normal, appropriate clauses are to be consulted. 
1.09 
It cannot be overemphasized that the sequence of courses, semester after semester, 
should be followed in the order presented in the Bulletin. Whenever it is detected that 
this order has been upset and at a certain point of reckoning a backlog of courses (see 
3.25) has accumulated, timely correction is imperative in order for the student to quickly 
fall into the line of orderly progress in the programme. In the absence of this correction, 
the student may suffer from an illusion of progress; He/she might have to pay dearly in 
terms of total time spent on his/her programme and the total academic objective of 
sequencing might also be permanently vitiated. These regulations, therefore, prescribe 
procedures by which making up for the backlog can be done simultaneously with a 
controlled forward movement on a course-by-course basis. When the student is unable 
to respond to this task and his/her backlog becomes large, he/she comes under the 
purview of Academic Counselling Board (ACB) (see 5.03). 
1.10 
 
*Note: Any reference to Dean, AUGS/AGSR within this document implies that 
for operations and policy implementation the Dean will be approached through the 
Associate Dean, AUGS/AGSR of the respective campuses. 
 
 
 
 
4 
To operate a system providing certain flexibilities within broad boundary 
limits, these regulations ensure supervision and monitoring at some key points. 
One such key point is the beginning of every semester when the student has to go 
through the requirement known as the registration procedure to work out his/her 
programme for the semester. No student is permitted to attend classes, without 
completing the appropriate registration procedure. 
1.11 
Another key point is the end of the semester when the student's performance 
in each course is pronounced in terms of letter grades or non-letter grades or 
reports (see 4.11 & 4.12). The letter grades have points associated with them in a 
quantified hierarchy, whereas the non-letter grades describe a qualitative hierarchy. 
The reports are not to be misconstrued as grades. All such grades and reports and 
other pertinent information for a semester are given in a grade sheet (see 4.22). 
Chronologically organised information from the grade sheets of a student with the 
necessary explanation constitutes his/her transcript which is issued at the time 
he/she leaves the Institute or at an intermediate point on request. 
1.12 
The grade sheet also contains the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). 
It is an overall performance as calculated by the method described in clause 4.21. It 
is also used for the declaration of division as per clause 9.04 when the 
programme/composite programme is completed. 
1.13 
While registration with the approval of the appropriate authority consistent 
with these regulations is a token of permission to pursue studies, the grade sheet is 
a complete record of the outcome of what was intended in the original/amended/ 
revised registration. The various grades and reports in clauses 4.11 & 4.12 would 
be appropriately used to tally the grade sheet with the original/ amended/revised 
registration. It would be evident that this tally between what was registered for and 
what was obtained in terms of grades and reports will apply to all courses except 
for any course which was originally registered for but subsequently replaced by 
another course through substitution. 
1.14 
The tally is made on a course-by-course basis at the conclusion of the semester 
to determine which of the courses have been cleared. A course is deemed to have 
been cleared if the student obtains a grade in the course. However, mere clearing 
of the prescribed courses on a course by course basis is not tantamount to fulfilling 
the requirements of graduation, for which see clauses 9.01 and 9.02. 
1.15 
Every registration in a semester in a course must terminate in an outcome 
which is a grade earned or report given. The completion of this linkage is defined 
as performance in the course for the semester. In a future performance in a course 
that has been already cleared, the status of clearing of the course would be 
determined by the latest performance. The consequence of obtaining a grade which 
is inadequate to fulfil the prerequisite conditions of a later course should be seen 
in clause 3.13. The consequences of the various reports are described in clauses 
4.13 to 4.20 with well-defined subsequent courses of action. Thus a course cleared 
and subsequently subjected to multiple registration may lose the status of clearing 
at a point of reckoning. 
1.16 
These regulations do not stipulate a minimum percentage of attendance before 
a student is permitted to appear in any test/examination. But the Institute being a 
fully residential university with internal and continuous evaluation system, these 
1.17 
 
5 
regulations clearly expect every student to be responsible for regularity of his/her 
attendance in class rooms and laboratories, to appear in scheduled tests and 
examinations and fulfil all other tasks assigned to him/her in every course. The 
system has adequate resilience to accommodate unforeseen situations through 
withdrawal, make-up, feedback from examinations and interaction with teachers. 
When in spite of all these facilities a student fails to cooperate with the teacher in 
the discharge of his/her part of the contract to such an extent that the teacher is 
unable to award any grade, the teacher is authorised by these regulations to give a 
‘Not Cleared’ (NC) report (see 4.19). The teacher concerned in a course or 
associated with a course is defined, for the purpose of these regulations, as 
Instructor or Instructor-in-charge (see 4.02). 
A student who is duly registered in a semester or has been permitted, after 
registration, to withdraw from the semester or has been given prior permission to 
stay away from the Institute for the semester or has been asked to stay away is 
considered to be on the rolls of the Institute for that semester. While such a student 
retains the nominal advantage of being on the rolls of the Institute the loss of time 
from studies and its consequences cannot be helped by the Institute. If for any valid 
reason a student is unable to register in a semester, he/she must seek prior 
permission from the Dean AUGS* (for on campus first degree programmes) or 
Dean AGSR* (for on campus higher degree programmes) or Dean WILP (for off 
campus programmes) to drop the semester. If such permission has not been 
requested or after a request, the permission has been denied, the student will be 
treated under clause 1.21 whereby his/her name would be struck off the rolls of the 
Institute. 
1.18 
Any appropriate Board/Committee of the Institute authorised by senate, such as 
Academic Counselling Board (ACB), Examination Committee (EC), Disciplinary 
Committee (DC) may require a student to stay away from the Institute for a semester 
or more when the authority is satisfied that by doing so the student will improve 
his/her overall progress, performance and conduct after he/she comes back. 
1.19 
When a student who has been permitted to stay away from the Institute for a 
semester or more comes back, his/her subsequent programme would be normally 
governed by the current academic structure and regulations. He/she cannot, ipso 
facto, claim to be governed by his/her earlier academic structure and regulations if in 
the meantime these have changed. 
1.20 
When a student fails to register in a semester without any prior permission to 
stay away, his/her name would be struck off the rolls of the Institute and he/she 
would no longer be a student of the Institute. His/her case will be automatically 
processed and the file will be closed. If, however, such a person, after his/her name 
has been struck off the rolls of the Institute, is permitted to come back, his/her case 
can be treated as in Clause 1.20 above with the proviso that all his/her previous 
records as a former student are revived under the current structure, regulations and 
schedule of fees. 
1.21 
These regulations incorporate many unusual flexibilities to allow innovations in 
education, and can accommodate many worthy educational goals. These flexibilities 
should, however, not be misconstrued to accommodate highly personalised 
ambitions inconsistent with these goals. Although they are available, it should be 
1.22 
 
6 
understood that they are not for the asking; they are awarded on a competitive basis 
and there are always limits to the total quantum of flexibilities. 
No application of these regulations will automatically entitle a student to any 
refund of fees except what is validated by the schedule of fees in force from time to 
time. On the other hand, certain implementation of these flexibilities may require 
additional fees. 
1.23 
The Institute may enter into collaboration with other universities whereby 
students of those universities register courses within the framework of these 
regulations according to mutually agreed guidelines. Such students will be known as 
External Students. Reciprocally, BITS students may be permitted to register courses 
in collaborating universities on a transfer of credit basis. 
1.24 
These regulations will apply uniformly to all on-campus and off-campus 
programmes except where otherwise indicated (see clause 1.00). Some additional 
regulations for off-campus programmes are given in Section 10. 
1.25 
 
2. Some Structural Features 
 
The education at BITS is in three levels, called tiers, the first tier being the 
integrated first degrees, the second being the higher degrees and the third being the 
Ph.D. degree. The academic structure in each of these tiers is unfolded by various 
components in a semester wise pattern. 
2.01 
First Tier 
 
A reference to the Bulletin will show that various programmes are bunched in 
different Groups. Without going into the details it is necessary to touch upon the 
subject to obtain a better understanding of the regulatory process controlled by these 
regulations in respect of operation within such Groups and across them. 
2.02 
 
 
There may be some restrictions from time to time in terms of flexibilities like 
transfer or dual degree concerning the degree programmes within the groups and 
among the groups.  This will be notified in the bulletin as per periodic decision of 
the Senate.  All operational matters concerning this will be controlled by Academic 
Governing Committee (AGC). 
2.03 
The various courses prescribed for a programme of study may be categorised 
in terms of their academic affinity or their functional objectives. Depending on the 
overall educational goals of programmes, it is possible to have fixed named courses 
in a particular category, to have a fixed number of electives; to have a range of 
named courses in a particular category, to have a number of electives within a 
range. Named courses are those indicated by course number and the course title in 
the semester-wise pattern prescribed for a programme. 
2.04 
For first degree students, the named courses include all mandatory courses 
under the General Institutional Requirement and the Discipline-specific Core 
courses for the program(s). The Elective courses fall under three categories: 
Discipline Electives, Humanities Electives, and Open Electives. Open Electives 
enable students to pursue courses that are not part of the discipline requirement nor 
2.05 
 
7 
part of the Humanities requirement. Normally any elective course will be treated 
as an Open Elective once the student’s requirements under Discipline Electives 
and Humanities Electives have been accounted for. Open elective requirement of 
Dual degree students is met by counting the Discipline electives of one degree as 
Open Electives of the other degree. A first degree student may also choose, where 
permitted, upto a certain prescribed maximum of his/her elective courses from the 
offerings in the second tier (i.e. higher degree), subject to the approval by the DCA 
(see clause 1.08(a)) and the prerequisite requirements and clause 3.18 regarding 
overpreparedness and underpreparedness. Provided that, if such a student after 
graduation is admitted to a higher degree programme his/her total requirement in 
the latter cannot ipso facto be reduced. A student may choose his/her Open Elective 
courses in a cogent way to meet the requirements of a minor program (see clause 
7.37 for minor programs). The Bulletin lists currently available minor programs 
and their requirements in detail. 
The prior preparation required of a student who intends to choose courses from 
a higher degree programme of the Institute for the fulfillment of his/her elective 
requirement(s) are given in clause 3.15. 
2.06 
In a programme all courses outside the elective categories are defined as named 
courses, in view of the fact that they have already been named in the semester-wise 
patterns in the Bulletin or have been named by an appointed authority through 
subsequent operation on the basis of guidelines given in the Bulletin. The electives 
are, on the other hand, selected by the student himself/herself from outside the named 
courses in his/her programme. The intended regions where he/she goes for the search 
will be designated as host regions. Certain specialised courses described in section 
6 do not conform to the pool of courses which can serve as host regions in the elective 
category. These courses are named courses for some specific programmes and they 
are debarred to other students as electives in the same way as they are debarred to 
students who wish to take them on audit (see 7.33). 
2.07 
For each programme the number of electives, under each of the categories (see 
2.05), required to be taken by a student will be prescribed either through the Bulletin 
or through an appropriate Committee. Over and above the prescribed number of 
electives, a student of an integrated first degree programme will be allowed to take, 
on his/her own option, upto a maximum number of four electives. In extraordinary 
cases, the number may be increased by the DCA without violating limit mentioned 
in 1.01. For the purpose of eligibility for degree(s), a student should get valid grades 
in at least the prescribed number of electives – under each of the categories, of his/her 
programme(s). Normally, a first degree student above a particular CGPA as 
prescribed by AGC will be allowed to register in maximum of one higher degree 
course per semester. This will be counted as an open elective unless the course is 
listed in the pool of discipline electives for his/her programme. 
2.08 
Once a first degree student is declared to have fulfilled the requirements of 
graduation the student may be permitted to register for at most one additional 
semester with the prior permission of his/her Head(s) of Department and Dean, 
AUGS. Any first degree student who is interested in pursuing open elective(s) above 
the graduation requirements and/or completing a minor program he/she is pursuing 
and if that necessitates overstay, he/she should obtain permission from Dean, AUGS 
at least one semester before the start of the overstay period. The overstay period can 
2.09 
 
8 
be at most one semester during which the student must register for at least three new 
courses of at least 9 units. In case a student withdraws from one or more of his/her 
courses or otherwise is found not to be pursuing his/her courses in all earnestness 
Dean, AUGS in concurrence with the student’s Head(s) of Department is authorized 
to get him/her graduated and evacuate the student from the campus. 
The structure contains a category of courses such as Practice School 
(PS)/Thesis (TS), which attempts a synthesis of earlier courses and gives a glimpse 
of the application of these courses. They carry a large number of units and are to 
be pursued when students can ensure sufficient time and attention throughout the 
allotted period. In particular, the Practice School components are to be pursued 
exclusively full time throughout the allotted period. There is no provision for 
taking other courses along with a Practice School component course. In case of the 
Thesis a student may choose between 9 units worth of Thesis work or 16 units 
worth of Thesis work with the concurrence of his/her supervisor. A student 
pursuing a 16 units Thesis must pursue it exclusively full time throughout the 
allotted period and there is no provision for taking other courses along with it. A 
student pursuing a 9 units Thesis may concurrently pursue at most 3 courses 
(totaling at most 9 units) and will not be allowed to pursue any other 
course/component. 
Students may be allowed to register for Thesis course operated at Off-campus 
locations by the Departmental Committee on Academics (DCA) recommendation 
and approval by the Dean, AUGS. A department may allow students to opt for a 
Thesis course operated at Off-campus locations based on the following criteria: 
• Students should normally look for reputed universities with well-
established research work in the area of proposed interest by an individual 
or a group. 
• The topic of the Thesis proposed by the student in consultation with the 
supervisor should be broadly relevant to the student's degree and aligned 
with research goals of the Institute. However, inter-disciplinary research 
may be allowed and even encouraged. 
• Credentials of proposed off-campus supervisor and letter of support for the 
thesis plans would be reviewed by the department. Financial assistance, full 
or partial, from the host university/organization is desirable but not 
essential. 
• Off-campus Research Organization/Universities which are listed as the 
Practice School Stations of BITS- Pilani will be considered for allotment 
by AUGSD only after consulting the PS Division. Students from BITS may 
not be allowed to work on similar projects in the same department/division 
of an industry under PS and TS options. 
• If necessary, the department will interact with the concerned students to 
evaluate their academic performance and research potential before 
permitting them to opt for a Thesis outside the institute. 
• The HoD of each department may form a committee of at least two senior 
faculty members to ensure that the above is implemented appropriately. 
 
2.10 
 
9 
The AUGS division shall issue operational guidelines from time to time, in line 
with the overall objectives of the Thesis course.  
 
Second Tier 
 
At the higher degree level, the structure of the programme is classified into 
courses, 
such 
as, 
Research 
Practice, 
Technical 
Communication, 
Core/Elective/General/Special Courses, Dissertation, Practice School, Internship, 
etc. Registration in Practice School or Internship (only for M.E. Collaborative 
programmes) can be done only after all other required courses have been 
completed.  In the case of Dissertation, while normal registration can be done only 
after completion of all other courses, in extraordinary cases, the DCA may allow 
registration in Dissertation, spread over various semesters, alongwith other 
courses. A student of a higher degree programme can register up to a maximum of 
one elective more than those prescribed in a semester. This additional elective can 
be from the pool of electives of the concerned degree or named/electives courses 
from other disciplines’ with the permission of DCAs – namely the DCA of the 
student’s Department and the DCA of the Department offering the course that the 
student wants to pursue. The grade obtained in such additional electives will also 
be counted towards the CGPA. Each course in the Core Requirement or in the List 
of Electives must be a graduate level (5th or 6th level) course or an advanced 
under-graduate course (4th level) with the restriction that a student may use at the 
most two 4th level courses to meet the requirements in above. 
2.11 
While a defined semester programme exists for M.E. (Collaborative) a case by 
case identification of courses is done in M.Phil. (Applied) programmes. For all other 
higher degrees, the semester wise programme is drawn up by the cross-campus DCA 
concerned (see 1.08(a)) ensuring distribution of prescribed units into Practice 
School/Dissertation/Research Practice/Technical Communication and other courses 
including Core/Elective/General/Special courses earmarked for any particular 
degree. 
2.12 
Third Tier 
 
The Ph.D. programme is designed for the student to achieve a broad 
competence before research begins. He/she is required to clear certain course work, 
if not already cleared, and pass the Qualifying Examination to satisfy the Institute 
that his/her spectrum of knowledge is such as to enable him/her to undertake the 
demands of interdisciplinary research. Working knowledge of a modern European 
language, wherever specified, Teaching Practice, Research Methodology and 
specified units of Thesis course and Seminar are significant components of the 
Ph.D. programme. The pursuit of research through the Thesis-Seminar course will 
continue and terminate in a thesis which meets the standard and requirement of the 
comity of scholars. University-Industry linkages that have been fostered over the 
years by the Institute have resulted in the Ph.D. programme moving into domains 
of up-to-date technology of national relevance, also enabling professionals of 
collaborating, associating and sponsoring organisations to pursue Ph.D. research 
of the Institute. 
2.13 
 
 
10 
3. Registration 
 
It has been described in Section 1 how every student once admitted to the 
Institute must pursue the prescribed programme which consists of a set of courses 
in successive semesters. Because of the structural flexibilities in the Bulletin and 
the flexibilities inherent in these regulations, the semester courses are not always 
predetermined. One of the objectives of the registration process is to name these 
courses at the beginning of each semester after allowing for the student's options 
and working out the permissible details within the limits prescribed by the rules 
and the announced Timetable. The Institute will always be in its right to refuse to 
initiate the registration process if a student, without valid reasons or without prior 
approval of the concerned Dean, has dues outstanding against him/her or has not 
paid his/her semester fees in advance. 
3.01 
Registration is not merely a routine event but it is a process which guides a 
student through the complexities of a flexible system. While these regulations 
provide a guidance to a student, registration advisors, the teachers, and the Deans in 
terms of all necessary detailed specifications of action, it is to be appreciated that 
Associate Dean AUGS/AGSR is in overall charge of the entire process at respective 
Campuses. It is in this capacity that he/she should be able to do all that is necessary 
and permitted in these regulations to make the registration process always a vital 
component and an instrument for furthering the cause of an innovative educational 
system. 
3.02 
The registration process for on-campus programmes is controlled by and is 
completed with the prior approval of Dean or Associate Dean AUGS (for first 
degree programmes), Dean or Associate Dean AGSR (for higher degree/PhD 
programmes) and Dean WILP for off-campus programmes; for the Seminar and 
Dissertation courses they are guided by Dean, AGSR and the First Degree Thesis 
is guided by Dean AUGS; wherever necessary for PS courses they are guided by 
Dean PS; and for Teaching Practice/Practice Lecture Series they are guided by 
Dean, AGSR. Dean or Associate Dean, AUGS/AGSR is assisted by a team of 
registration advisors who are appointed by him/her. 
3.03 
Registration for the semester programmes for every individual student, whether 
newly admitted or already on rolls, will be at the beginning of each semester on dates 
to be announced. Every student is required to register for his/her semester programme 
in person and to get his/her registration properly completed at his/her own 
responsibility, failing which he/she shall not be permitted to attend any classes or use 
any of the facilities of the Institute. The registration must be done at the location 
where the student pursuing his/her semester of study. 
3.04 
 
 
 
11 
To meet unusual circumstances, Dean, AUGS/AGSR (for on campus 
programmes) or Dean, WILP (for off campus programmes)  is vested with the 
discretionary authority to determine whether a late registration can be permitted on a 
case by case basis and also to determine whether such a late registration can be done 
with or without payment of requisite fine. In case of courses like PS, courses of off-
campus programmes, Thesis, and Dissertation, and courses of all the three tiers when 
conducted at off-campus centres, or whenever Dean PS or Dean AUGS/AGSR or 
Dean WILP, as the case may be, faces practical difficulty of maintaining proper 
coordination between the campus and these centres, they will make suitable 
recommendations to Dean, AUGS/AGSR. 
3.05 
Whenever a late registration is contemplated beyond one week of the beginning 
of class work, in all the above cases, the concurrence of Dean, AUGS/AGSR/WILP 
should be obtained for making the contemplated late registration possible. 
3.06 
The registration in a semester, when altered at the initiative of a student (see 
3.26) will be called an amended registration. On the other hand, when a registration 
already done is altered by other events, it will be called a revised registration (see 
3.27). For the purpose of reference the first registration in a semester will be hereafter 
referred to as original registration to distinguish it from subsequent amendments or 
revisions, if any. 
3.07 
While drawing up the registration programme for the semester and subsequent 
amendments and revisions, if any, the student, registration advisor and Dean, 
AUGS/AGSR will pay particular attention to the conditions listed in the clauses as 
under: 
3.08 
A. Original Registration: All students (see 3.09 to 3.20) 
B. 
Original Registration: Additional regulations for students departing from 
normal (see 3.21 to 3.25). 
C. 
Amendment to Original Registration: All students (see 3.26). 
D. Revision of Original/Amended Registration: All students (see 3.27).  
 
A. 
Original Registration: All students 
A student is not permitted to register in a semester if (i) he/she has dues 
outstanding to the Institute, hostel, or any recognised organ of the Institute, or (ii) 
his/her grade sheet in his/her immediately preceding semester is withheld, or (iii) 
he/she has an ‘Incomplete’ report ‘I’ in his/her grade sheet in his/her immediately 
preceding semester or (iv) he/she has been specifically debarred or asked to stay 
away from that semester. 
3.09 
Where a ‘Grade Awaited’ (GA) report (see 4.15) appears in his/her grade sheet 
in his/her immediately preceding semester, Dean, AUGS/AGSR/WILP will act in the 
matter of registration, according to provisions of Clause 4.16. 
3.10 
Certain exigencies of situations may occur like registration in PS I, etc., where 
the closing of the previous semester and the registration in such a course invariably 
has a very thin time gap. In such situations, when the Dean/Associate Dean has 
reasonable evidence of good faith on the part of the student that nothing under 
Clause 3.09 will prevent registration, the registration in such a course will be 
3.11 
 
12 
permitted, which will be subject to cancellation without notice if the student is 
discovered later on to be suffering from any of the conditions of Clause 3.09. 
A student should not without sufficient justification depart from the normal 
semester pattern as applicable in his/her case. The semester-wise pattern of various 
programmes and combination of programmes are presented in the Bulletin or would 
be made available at the time of admission for cases not available in the Bulletin. 
3.12 
Before a student can register in a course, he/she should have fulfilled the 
prerequisite conditions attached to that this course.  
3.13 
Clause 1.06 has stated that before registering in certain courses or a group of 
courses, a specified prior preparation is required. These requirements are described in 
the following table where the second column describes the courses to be cleared by the 
student prior to the registration in course or courses given in the first column, the two 
columns having a one-to-one correspondence (Read in conjunction with Clause 2.07 
for definition of ‘named courses’ and Clause 6.08 for the effect of delay of PS I on 
Core Courses. 
(a) For first degree students: 
3.14 
(i) PS I for single/dual degree 
(i) 
Normally all courses in the 
semesters preceding PS I for 
his/her 
programme/composite 
programme. 
(ii) PSII/TS 
for 
single/dual 
degree 
(ii) All named courses of his/her 
programme/composite 
programme including PS I, other 
than TS/PS-II. 
(iii) For any other prescribed 
semester 
of 
single/dual 
degree 
(iii) All named courses in semesters 
and terms preceding this set of 
courses in his/her programme. 
 
 
However, in case of (iii) above, the DCA may examine the case of a student 
who has not cleared at most two courses out of the prior-preparation package and if 
the “not cleared courses” has no direct bearing on the Core courses, a modified 
semester wise pattern may be recommended by the DCA so that the student meets 
the prior-preparation requirements and is able to register in the prescribed semester 
courses. As much as feasible, in the modified semester-wise pattern the backlog 
course(s) must be given first. In modified semester-wise pattern, the pre-requisite 
conditions must still be fulfilled. However, the finalization of the semester-wise 
pattern is subject to availability and other operational constraints on courses and 
therefore will be the prerogative of the Dean, AUGS/AGSR. 
 
Clauses 2.09 give the student an opportunity to choose courses to fulfil the 
elective category. In the search for courses the student may go to the general course 
pool of the Institute offerings in that semester outside his/her own discipline(s) and 
outside the Humanities Electives pool as well. However, before he/she is permitted to 
register in any course from the above pool the following conditions have to be 
remembered: 
3.15 
(a) General conditions: Prerequisites (see 3.13), overpreparedness & 
underpreparedness (see 3.18), 
 
 
13 
(b) Additional further conditions presented in the second column for the host 
regions described in the first column in the following table on a one-to-one 
correspondence. (Read in conjunction with clause 2.07 for definition of `host 
region' and with clause 3.14 for prior preparation for core courses): 
(i) 
Discipline (Core or Elective) 
course  of a degree other than 
student's own degree(s) 
(i) 
Must have completed the prior-
preparation of the third year first 
semester 
of 
his/her 
own 
programme. 
 
(ii) Courses of a higher degree of 
his/her own discipline(s) 
(ii) 
After clearing first set of his/her 
own Discipline core courses in the 
case of single degree. After 
clearing the first set of his/her 
Discipline core courses of the 
corresponding degree in the case of 
dual degree. Note that the first set 
of Discipline core courses are 
prescribed in the second year of the 
semester wise pattern of a single 
degree student; in the second year 
for the first degree and in the third 
year for the second degree of a dual 
degree student. 
 
However, special vigilance should be exercised by all concerned before 
registration is done. 
3.16 
Further the appearance of any report like NC (see 4.19) or the outcome of a 
course in which a student had registered even after obtaining a grade should be 
examined for appropriate actions. 
3.17 
Unless specifically permitted by these regulations (see 3.25II) no student can 
register in a course if He/she is considered to be overprepared or underprepared in 
relation to the contents of the course. 
3.18 
The semester programme drawn up finally should be free from any Timetable 
conflict. 
3.19 
If these regulations mandatorily require a registration for a specific course and 
in the meantime the course has ceased to be offered, Dean, AUGS/AGSR/WILP 
will name, for this limited purpose, another academically similar course from the 
current offerings and assign to it the same units as that of the specific course. 
3.20 
B. 
Original Registration: Additional regulations for students departing 
from normal 
The departures from the normal pattern are to be pinpointed and quantified by 
making a tally of courses in what is known as eligibility sheet. The eligibility sheet 
of the student is updated at the conclusion of every semester by entering against 
each course his/her performance in that course in that semester (grade or report). 
This process when carried out every semester gives also the multiple performances, 
if any, in a course over the semesters. The courses a student has repeated under 
3.21 
 
14 
clause 3.25 II or has been required to register again by appropriate authority 
would thus be easily identified from the eligibility sheet. Before doing a semester 
registration a student is first located in the proper point of reckoning (which is 
invariably the beginning of a semester/term in the semester wise pattern of his/her 
prescribed programme). For students admitted with advanced standing this 
location is done on a notional basis. On the other hand, for students in single 
degree, dual degree, students admitted with marginal deficiency, students admitted 
in the second semester and students who have gone through one or more transfers, 
this is done with reference to the student's date of entry into the Institute. Now, this 
semester of operation is designated as current semester for the student. All 
courses which appear in the current semester are called prescribed semester 
courses, to be denoted by (PSC). Any course appearing before the (PSC) is said to 
be a course appearing in the past region. Any course which appears later than the 
(PSC) is said to be a higher level course (named course or elective slot). The 
identification of (PSC) and the higher level courses, however, is subject to 
occasional switching of courses between adjoining semesters as announced by 
Dean, AUGS/AGSR through the Timetable. 
A student may at his/her own responsibility depart from his/her (PSC) when 
feasible and permissible in these regulations. The pattern and the pace such a 
student follows for himself/herself cannot be offered as a modification of his/her 
prescribed programme (see 1.07). 
3.22 
A student with an intelligent understanding of the application of these rules 
can make a plan to graduate earlier or later than the time visualized in the Bulletin. 
However, any student who departs from the normal pace should in his/her own 
interest ensure that he/she remains outside the provisions of the sanctions described 
in clause 5.02 and will be well advised to seek guidance from the Registration 
Advisors or Dean, AUGS/AGSR to make suitable prior planning, consistent with 
predictable information on Timetable constraints, prerequisite requirements, and 
other registration procedures, so that his/her overenthusiasm or lack of application 
does not cause him/her avoidable disappointment. 
3.23 
A student departs from his/her normal pattern whenever (i) He/she repeats a 
course He/she has already cleared (see 3.25 II), (ii) takes a higher level course 
concurrently with his/her current semester courses (see 3.25 III), (iii) accumulates a 
backlog (see 3.25 I), (iv) decides to take the electives earlier or later than where they 
are located in his/her programme. 
3.24 
The original registration in a semester and its subsequent amendment, if any, 
for such students are subject to additional conditions attached to each item of 
departure listed as under : 
3.25 
(i) 
Clearing the backlog with controlled forward movement (clauses (a) to (g) 
in 3.25 I) 
(ii) Repeating a course (clauses(h) to (l) in 3.25 II) 
(iii) Taking a higher level course (clause (m) in 3.25 III) 
(iv) Deciding when to register for electives (clause(n) in 3.25 IV) 
 
 
 
 
15 
But in all cases a student has to first take up the task of 3.25 I before He/she 
takes as an additional burden of either 3.25 II, III or IV or a combination thereof. 
However, the computation of (BL) and (PSC) is further subject to clause (n) in 3.25 
IV. 
 
I. 
Clearing the backlog with controlled forward movement 
3.25 I 
(a) Continuing the procedure introduced in clause 3.21, the total backlog for 
a student at a point of reckoning will consist of all courses located in the 
past region of the semester wise pattern which are identified by the 
following steps of operations: 
 
(i) Any course from which the consequences of NC have not yet been 
removed by the student; 
(ii) Any course in which the student has not yet obtained a grade; and 
(iii) Amongst the remaining courses with grades, any course (say, 
course No.1) where the latest grade obtained by a student is 
inadequate to meet the prerequisite requirements of a later course 
(say, course No.2) and the student has yet to register in course No. 
2 now (as part of (BL) or part of (PSC) or in future in view of the 
fact that course No. 2 suffers from NC or has no grade or has an 
inadequate grade for the prerequisite requirements of course No. 3, 
for which the student has to register under the same circumstance 
described for course No. 2 and so on until the last course of the 
prerequisite chain has been accounted for (see 3.13). 
 
The total backlog at the beginning of registration in the current semester taken 
as the point of reckoning would be the union of the above three sets (i), (ii) and 
(iii) and would be denoted by (BL). 
 
(b) Every student in a semester must first register in his/her backlog courses. 
In other words, (BL) is the first charge on his/her registration. Only when 
He/she so registers in the full component of (BL) He/she can register in 
his/her (PSC). And only when He/she is also registered in the full 
component of (PSC) He/she can register in higher level courses/ repeat a 
course which He/she has already cleared (see 3.25 II & III). Any 
subsequent amendments (withdrawal or substitution) to the original 
registration must be done stepwise first on the higher level and repeat 
courses. Only when higher level and repeat courses are fully removed any 
amendment can be done on the (PSC). Only when the (PSC) have been 
fully removed, any amendment can be done on the (BL) courses. 
 
(c) The general rule enunciated at (b) above for (BL) and (PSC) may not be 
operable in certain practical situations. The particular course may not be 
available in the Timetable in the current semester, the student may not have 
met the prerequisite of some courses even if they are available in the 
Timetable or the student may have already cleared with adequate grade one 
of the courses in the current semester as a higher level course in an earlier 
semester. For the purpose of this practical need, the (BL) will be suitably 
reduced to the full component of its operative portion called (OBL) and the 
(PSC) will be reduced to the full component of its operative portion called 
(OPSC). 
 
 
16 
(d) Recognising that there may be Timetable conflict even within the (OBL) 
and also between a course in (OBL) and a course in (OPSC) which is linked 
by prerequisite condition with a higher level course, Dean, AUGS/AGSR 
is authorised to name in such a combined situation what the full 
components of (OBL) and (OPSC) are in which the student must register. 
In giving his/her decision the Dean will be guided by the overall 
requirement that an attempt to clear up (OBL) may not create a situation 
where delay in the above mentioned prerequisite course of the (OPSC) 
would generate more backlog in future. Whenever subsequent operations 
refer to (OBL) and (OPSC), care has to be exercised to find out whether 
these are the full components of the (OBL) and (OPSC) or they are only 
effective residues of (OBL), (OPSC) created by the above process. 
 
(e) It should be obvious from the above that if a student merely remains 
registered for a part of the (OBL) He/she has no opportunity to register in 
any other course in that semester. Similarly, a student who has no (OBL) 
to do and remains registered only in a part of (OPSC) cannot take any other 
course in that semester. See (d) above for the usage of (OBL) and (OPSC). 
 
(f) Recalling that the purpose of backlog computation was to determine what 
controlled forward movement on a course by course basis is possible, 
computation of backlog has no meaning where even one course as a 
backlog prevents further registration. In such cases, it is the rule regarding 
prior preparation which will determine what forward movement is 
possible. The requirements of prior preparation for registering in PS/TS for 
single or dual degree scheme situations are available in clause 3.14. A 
somewhat complicated situation exists in the case of Core Courses for 
single or dual degree scheme, where the prior preparation is given in the 
same clause for the first registration in the Core Courses: When Core 
Courses in a semester coexist with other courses, the backlog computation 
and its application will apply to only the courses which coexist with Core 
Courses; and for Core Courses the prior preparation clause will operate. 
This process determines separately how registration has to be done for 
these two portions of the semester courses. Further, once the clause has 
been applied to any Core Course for the first time, a subsequent registration 
in later semesters in any of the Core Courses will take place as if there was 
no distinction between Core Courses and any other course, as far as the 
backlog computation is concerned. 
 
(g) It is to be noted that the emphasis on a need to clear up the backlog also 
incidentally averts the sanctions of clause 5.02 (iii). When this does not 
happen, the sanction clause 5.02 takes over and a student goes under the 
purview of ACB as per provisions of clause 5.03. While a student is under 
the purview of ACB he/she looses the freedom of operation envisaged in 
this section. It is therefore very much in the interest of the student to take 
advantage of the fact that backlog removal and a controlled forward 
movement are far better than going under the purview of ACB, wherein 
even this degree of forward movement is heavily reduced in view of the 
burden which He/she places on ACB. 
 
 
17 
II. Repeating a course 
3.25 II 
(h) If the Institute facilities permit, a student who is still in the process of 
completing the requirements of a degree, may, at his/her own option, 
repeat, with a view to improving his/her grade, a course which He/she has 
already cleared, provided the course forms part of the current prescribed 
programme for the student. 
 
(i) 
This facility for repeating a course already cleared will automatically cease 
to be available to a student when He/she has completed the requirements 
of graduation or he/she is just short of graduation by courses like PS and 
Thesis-Seminar (in first and second tiers) which cannot be taken 
concurrently with any other course. 
 
(j) 
The Practice School courses, Thesis, Seminar, Internship and other courses 
of the M.E. (Collaborative)/M.Phil. (Applied), project courses and other 
courses specifically so debarred in the Bulletin cannot, however, be 
repeated except when ACB require a student to register again. 
 
(k) Repeating a course is possible only after the full component of (BL) (if 
any) and the full component of (PSC) has been registered for in the 
semester and continues to be so registered. Any subsequent amendment to 
the original registration can be done only according to clause 3.25 I (b) 
above. Consult also Clauses 3.25 I(c) & 3.25 I (d) for the operative portions 
of (BL) and (PSC). 
 
(l) 
It would be obvious from (k) above and the general requirement of 
progress from semester to semester, that it is not possible to spend an entire 
semester exclusively for repetition of courses (see 7.07 for summer term 
situation). 
 
III. Taking a higher level course 
3.25 III 
(m) Registering in a higher level course is possible only after the full 
component of (BL), if any, and the full component of (PSC) has been 
registered for in the semester and continues to be so registered. Any 
subsequent amendment to the original registration can be done only 
according to clause 3.25 I (b) above. Consult also Clauses 3.25 I(c) & 3.25 
I (d) for the operative portions of (BL) and (PSC). 
 
IV. Deciding when to register for electives 
3.25 IV 
(n) With a view to planning his/her entire quota of courses under the category 
of electives, a student may, at his/her own responsibility, delay or advance 
taking the electives with reference to their prescribed appearance in the 
semester wise pattern. To ensure this privilege the operation of Clauses 
3.25 I, II and III above will be made after the components of electives have 
been removed from the packages constituting (PSC) and (BL). It must, 
however, be understood that this facility is only for the limited purpose of 
registration as envisaged in these clauses and does not affect the 
application of any other clause. 
 
 
 
 
18 
C. Amendment to Original Registration: 
3.26 
Amendments to original registration are invariably initiated by the student 
himself/herself and are covered by the conditions listed as under: 
 
(a) Any time within two weeks from the beginning of the semester (or one 
week from the beginning of the summer term) a student may request the 
Dean, AUGS/AGSR (for on-campus)/Dean WILP (for off-campus) for 
Substitution, by another course, of a course in which he/she has already 
registered. 
 
(b) If a student desires to withdraw from a course, he/she may submit a formal 
application for Withdrawal from the course to Dean, AUGS/AGSR (for 
on-campus)/Dean WILP (for off-campus) within ten weeks from the 
beginning of the semester (or five weeks from the beginning of the summer 
term). 
 
(c) In exceptional circumstances, a student may be permitted by Dean, 
AUGS/AGSR (for on-campus)/Dean WILP (for off-campus), to withdraw 
from any course(s) or all courses when the Dean is satisfied as to the 
genuineness of the extenuating circumstances. 
 
(d) In the above matter of withdrawal within normal time and withdrawal in 
exceptional circumstances, Dean, AUGS/AGSR will act on the 
recommendation of Dean PS for Practice School courses; of Dean, AGSR 
for a student who is registered in Thesis/Seminar/Independent study, 
Dissertation, Teaching Practice/Practice Lecture Series course; of Dean 
WILP for a student who is registered in any off-campus programme. 
 
(e) No amendments through withdrawal or substitution in the original 
registration can be initiated by the student if the net result of this 
amendment is to undo the discretionary decision of the Dean concerned at 
the time of the original registration in regard to certain courses and their 
interdependence like (BL), (PSC), repeat/higher level course (see 3.25 
I(d)). 
 
(f) A student who has come under the purview of ACB ceases to have any 
initiative in the amendment of his/her original registration. As provided in 
Clauses 5.03 and 5.04 ACB determines the courses in which a student must 
register during all the semesters in which he/she remains under the purview 
of ACB. When any alteration in the original registration is called for it will 
be done entirely at the discretion of ACB. 
 
D. Revision of Original/Amended Registration: All Students 
 
The revision of original/amended registration can be caused by concerned 
authority any time during the semester/term as per details listed as under: 
3.27 
(a) If the registration of a student in a course is not found to be in accordance 
with these regulations, his/her registration in that course will be 
cancelled and the grade obtained, if any, will be rejected. 
 
(b) The registration of a student in a course or complete set of courses in a 
semester can be revised through the instrument of RC (see 4.18) by the 
concerned authority when He/she is found guilty in cases of unfair means, 
 
 
19 
breach of discipline, etc., or when He/she persistently and deliberately does 
not pay off his/her dues. 
(c) Dean AGSR may cause a revision of registration already done to 
accommodate entry into the Ph.D. programme (see 8.08 and 8.44) or to 
include Ph.D. Thesis registration (see 8.21) or to cancel a Thesis 
registration (see 6.23). He/she should, however, ensure that whenever 
He/she causes such a revision to be made in respect of courses where a 
grade is required at the end of the current semester, He/she allows adequate 
time for meaningful grade to emerge. 
 
(d) Dean PS may cause a revision of registration already done by cancellation 
of the PS option (see 6.13); Dean WILP by cancellation from the off-
campus programmes and in the special situation provided in clause 4.20(e), 
through the instrument RRA/DP. (For symbols DP, RRA, see 4.12). 
 
(e) Dean, AUGS/AGSR may cause a revision of registration already done, 
when a student ceases to be on the rolls of the Institute by his/her own 
action or by the action of the Institute, by cancelling registration in all 
courses (see 4.18). 
 
(f) ACB may cause a revision of registration already done of a student who is 
under its purview (see 5.03 & 5.04). 
 
(g) Revision of registration already done may be modified by the concerned 
Dean/Associate Dean. 
 
(i) 
by allowing students to register in additional courses; 
(ii) by canceling the registration of a course in which the student has 
already registered; when the situation warrants. 
 
(h) If for a student who is already registered, there is a delay for unavoidable 
reasons in the announcement of decisions on transfer, dual degree, etc. 
the registration will be revised by an appropriate authority to 
accommodate these decisions, if necessary.

4. Teaching and Evaluation 
 
The objective of class room education is to awaken the curiosity of the 
student, generate habits of rational thinking in him/her, gear his/her mind to face 
the unfamiliar and train him/her to be able to stand on his/her own. While class 
room instruction helps the student in the organisation and correlation of facts, in 
comprehension of ideas and the creative use of knowledge, the teacher has the 
added responsibility to make the student search for knowledge on his/her own and 
induce him/her to use the facilities like the library, laboratory and the environment 
to optimize his/her learning process. Self-study by the student would therefore, be 
an important factor in the planning of teaching and evaluation. The student is 
required to cooperate and respond to this challenge. Teaching and evaluation form 
a unity of function and operate in a climate of mutual understanding and trust. To 
ensure a shared responsibility, the regulations indicate some formal guidance. 
4.01 
Every course whether single section or multi-section is conducted by a member 
of the faculty called instructor-in-charge, with the assistance, where necessary, of the 
required number of instructors who will be partners with him/her in meeting the full 
academic perceptions and organisational needs of teaching the course and evaluating 
the students. Wherever the instructor-in-charge is mentioned in these regulations it 
connotes the team of instructors, acting as one entity under his/her captainship. 
4.02 
The instructor or the team of instructors should make a comprehensive plan in 
respect of conducting the course even before the semester begins and in a multi-
section course remain in continuous interaction in order to ensure a smooth operation 
of the course. While recognising variations due to personal attitudes and styles, it is 
important that these are smoothened out so that the operation and grading in the 
different sections in a course, indeed between courses across the Institute; are free 
from any seeming arbitrariness. 
4.03 
Within one week of the beginning of classwork, the instructor-in-
charge/instructor must announce to his/her class/section through a hand-out, the 
necessary information in respect of (i) the operations of the course (its pace, 
coverage and level of treatment, textbooks and other reading assignments, home 
tasks etc.); (ii) various components of evaluation, such as tutorials, laboratory 
exercises, home assignment, several quizzes/tests/examinations (announced or 
unannounced, open book or closed book), regularity of attendance, etc., (iii) the 
frequency, duration, tentative schedule, relative weightage etc. of these various 
components; (iv) the broad policy which governs decisions about make-up; (v) 
mid-semester grading; (vi) grading procedure (overall basis, review of border line 
cases, effect of class average, etc.) and (vii) other matters found desirable and 
relevant. 
4.04 
 
 
 
21 
For all structured courses there will be minimum of three components of 
evaluation including one Comprehensive Examination. The different components of 
evaluation should be evenly spread out in the semester and would aim to draw out 
response from the student in regard to various attributes like spontaneous recall, 
ability to apply known concepts, capacity to work on his/her own, competence in 
conceptualised arguments, ability to face unknown situations, etc. At least one of the 
components (examination) must be comprehensive enough to include the whole 
course and will be held at the end of the semester.  
At least 20% of the evaluation component must be open book in the form of 
written tests or take-home assignments for a first degree course. At least 40% of 
evaluation components must be open book in the form of written tests/ take-home 
assignments for a higher degree course. A higher degree course should also include 
two or more research-oriented activities (Literature Survey, Seminars/ Presentations/ 
Research Summaries, Design/ Development of processes/ products/ artifacts, 
Experimental or Quantitative Analysis of processes/ products/ phenomena, Design 
of Experiments, etc.) and include at most 60% of evaluation components in the form 
of Tests/Exams.  
4.05 
The components and the instruments of evaluation in certain courses like PS, 
Teaching Practice, Research Practice, Thesis, Seminar, Dissertation and courses of 
off-campus programmes follow a different regimen and methodology. Details in 
respect of most of them are presented in section 6. 
4.06 
It shall be the responsibility of the individual student to be in attendance in all 
classes and to take prescribed quizzes, tests, examinations and to submit properly and 
promptly all homework. Any student who misses any component of evaluation must 
immediately approach the instructor-in-charge so that the instructor-in-charge, if 
He/she is satisfied as to the bonafide of the request, may arrange as soon as possible 
a make-up approximating as closely as possible the circumstances of the component 
of evaluation which the student missed. If, on a rare occasion, a student anticipates a 
genuine difficulty of meeting the date of the component of evaluation, He/she would 
do well to take his/her instructor-in-charge into confidence prior to the event. The 
decision of the instructor-in-charge in all matters of make-up shall be final. 
4.07 
Just as evaluation is done in a continuous manner, feedback should also be 
available in a continuous manner. Thus the answerscripts must be promptly 
evaluated, shown to the students for them to obtain any clarification on their own 
performance and returned to the students whenever practicable. The performance of 
the students in the examination should be discussed in the class giving as much detail 
as possible like the highest, lowest and average performances. 
4.08 
At the conclusion of the semester a student is awarded a grade in each of the 
courses He/she has taken during this period. The grade awarded to a student in a 
course will depend on his/her total performance in all the components of evaluation 
as designed by the instructor-in-charge. Apart from grades the instructor-in-charge 
also reports by suitable words, certain events/facts and these reports should not be 
misconstrued as grades (see 4.11 & 4.12). 
4.09 
 
22 
The instructor-in-charge is responsible for holding the examinations, 
awarding final grades and transmitting the grades/reports to Dean, 
AUGS/AGSR/WILP within the deadline set by him/her. This deadline is set in 
consistence with clause 4.25.

*Note: Non-Letter Grade ‘CLR’ indicates that the course is 
cleared to fulfill graduation requirements. As this is a non-
letter grade it will not affect CGPA and was awarded on 
meeting the minimum criteria set for clearing the said 
course (i.e. even though some components are missed by 
the student, the overall performance was good in other 
evaluated components). This provision came into force 
during academic year 2020-21.

The various reports listed below are elaborated in the subsequent clauses as 
specified below: 
4.12 
(i) 
Incomplete ‘I’ described in clauses 4.13 & 4.14; 
 
(ii) Grade Awaited (GA) described in clauses 4.15 & 4.16; 
 
(iii) Withdrawn (W) described in clause 4.17; 
 
(iv) Registration Cancelled (RC), Required to Register Again (RRA) and 
Discontinued from the Programme (DP), all described in clause 4.18; 
and 
 
(v) Not Cleared (NC) described in clauses 4.19 & 4.20. 
 
(vi) Thesis Grade Awaited (TGA) described in clause 4.15a. 
 
(vii) Allowed to Continue (AC) described in clause 4.15b. 
 
If the instructor-in-charge finds a student to have not fulfilled some of the 
requirements of a course before the final deadline for transmitting the grade, and 
he/she is satisfied that he/she is able to transmit some grade or a report with or without 
this particular fulfillment, but at his/her discretion wishes to give the student an 
opportunity, he/she may, within the deadline, send a report ‘I’ (Incomplete) and also 
inform the student of the same. It shall be the responsibility of the student to contact 
the instructor-in-charge in time for the replacement of the `I' report within two weeks 
after the end of the semester (and within one week after the end of the summer term, 
for a summer term course) which may be relaxed by Dean, AUGS/AGSR for on-
campus programmes and by Dean WILP for off-campus programmes, failing which 
the instructor-in-charge will communicate whatever grade/report is possible for the 
situation. Whenever such relaxation is made, Dean, AUGS/AGSR/Dean WILP will 
specify at his/her discretion, with the consent of the instructor-in-charge, the date by 
which `I' report has to be converted. 
4.13 
The requirements envisaged in clause 4.13 must be completed within the time 
allowed by Associate Dean, AUGS/AGSR/Dean, WILP. If the extra time given 
goes beyond the registration in the next semester/term (see 3.04) no registration in 
the next semester/ term is possible and the student should seek permission to stay 
4.14 
 
24 
away as per clause 1.18. In the event either the instructor-in-charge or Dean, 
AUGS/AGSR/WILP rejects the request for the extra time, the provisions of 
clause 4.13 will operate. 
There are many situations where operational and practical difficulties may cause 
a delay in the communication of a grade. Certain situations which are visualised in 
this connection are: (i) where a case of unfair means is pending; (ii) where a case of 
indiscipline is pending; and (iii) where the courses are being conducted at an off-
campus centre for PS students, for off-campus students or for Ph.D. students and 
where precise coordination between the Institute and these centres may not work in 
a timely manner. In these circumstances, the Dean concerned (Dean, AUGS/AGSR 
for (i), Associate Dean Students' Welfare for (ii), and Dean PS/Dean WILP for (iii)) 
may make a specific authorization for the instructor-in-charge to report GA (Grade 
Awaited). The Dean concerned above will also simultaneously advise Dean, 
AUGS/AGSR the estimated time by which the grades will be received. 
4.15 
Where a Ph.D. Thesis has been submitted and the final evaluation is pending, 
the Dean, AGSR/Dean WILP will report TGA as part of evaluation for thesis 
submitted for PhD students. 
4.15a 
For evaluation of Dissertation course, in case the Dissertation course is 
offered in split form in more than one semester, with the prior approval of the 
concerned Dean, student may be given, in semesters other than the final one, an 
interim report ‘AC’ (allowed to continue) when the teacher feels that there is 
satisfactory progress and the student will be allowed to continue the dissertation 
for the remaining units in the subsequent semesters. For operational purpose the 
report AC will be same as I or GA. When the final grade in dissertation emerges, 
it will replace AC report in the previous semesters. However, where the student 
has not done any work the award of NC will continue to remain. Furthermore this 
does not apply for the case of Dissertation of extended duration (see 6.16b) wherein 
the student must be registered in a different(ly numbered) Dissertation course in 
each of the semesters involved. In the latter case, a valid grade must be awarded 
for that Dissertation course at the end of each semester. 
4.15b 
Whenever the report GA appears in the grade sheet, permission for further 
registration of such a student will be acted upon by the Dean, AUGS/AGSR on the 
recommendation of the concerned authority (see 4.15). 
4.16 
Whenever a student is allowed to withdraw from a course, the same is 
recorded in his/her grade sheet as W (Withdrawn). Whenever a semester 
performance in a course is reported as W, for all operations of these regulations 
which are dependent on performance the W will be ignored; this means one should 
go backward to the previous performance, if any, which takes over and this process 
must be repeated until one reaches a performance which cannot be ignored. 
4.17 
Where a student's registration for a course has to be cancelled this fact will be 
reported in his/her grade sheet as RC (Registration Cancelled); however, since an RC 
by itself may have many meanings, this reporting is subject to the following. If it is 
clearly known that the student will be required to register again in the same course it 
will be reported as RRA (Required to Register Again). If the RC amounts to 
discontinuation from the programme or the programme option it will be reported as 
DP (Discontinued from the programme), (see also 6.13, 6.23 & 4.20 (e)). If the 
4.18 
 
25 
cancellation of registration is not reported either as RRA or as DP but is reported as 
RC, it does not necessarily mean that it is free from any constraint. The meaning of 
the constraint has to be constructed from the context in which RC was reported. An 
innocuous RC has to be ignored for all purposes of registration and operations of 
these regulations which are dependent on performance. This means that one should 
go backwards to a performance which cannot be ignored, as described in clause 4.17 
for W. 
Where a student continued to remain registered in a course but gave the 
instructor inadequate opportunity to evaluate him/her by absenting 
himself/herself from quizzes/ tests/ examinations/other components of 
evaluation, or by appearing in the same for the sake of appearance without 
applying himself/herself to the task in hand or by submitting a blank script 
(answer book) this event will be reported as NC (Not Cleared) (also see 1.17). 
The student so reported would have to register again in the same course as per 
Clause 4.20 as soon as necessary. In the case of courses like 
Thesis/Seminar/Dissertation etc. where the evaluation may not be arrived at 
through such formalised structures as quizzes/tests/examinations the periodic 
task given by the supervisor or the instructor would be the basis to determine 
whether a student is cooperating with him/her for him/her to arrive at a grade 
in any semester/term as provided in these regulations. For consequence of NC 
report in Thesis/Seminar/Dissertation/Practice School see clause 4.20 (d) & 
(e). 
4.19 
Whenever a student gets an NC report in a course irrespective of whether He/she 
has a grade in the course or not earlier to this event the following will govern further 
action. It is to be noted that an NC cannot be ignored, except under the situations 
described in (b) and (c) below: 
4.20 
(a) Whenever a student gets an NC report in a course which is in the 
compulsory package of his/her programme He/she is required to again 
register in the same course and get a valid grade therein. 
 
(b) If a student has an NC report in a course taken as elective, He/she can either 
repeat the course to get a valid grade or ignore it to choose another course 
(subject to a maximum limit as per clause 2.08). However, a student must 
get valid grades in atleast the prescribed number of electives in his/her 
programme. 
 
(c) Whenever a student's record has an NC in a course which remains 
unaccounted after a process of transfer has been completed (see 7.19), it 
will not be possible for him/her to wipe out the NC report in such a course 
because this course is not a part of his/her programme anymore; and he/she 
can graduate with this NC. 
 
(d) If a student is reported NC in Thesis or Seminar or Dissertation, he/she will 
be required to register in the same for one more semester. Operationally 
this is to be achieved by requiring him/her to register once again in as many 
units of Thesis or Seminar or Dissertation in which he/she was registered 
when he/she was reported NC. 
 
(e) It is to be clarified that there cannot be an NC report in the PS courses, 
M.E. (Collaborative)/ M.Phil. (Applied) courses and some other courses. 
 
 
26 
Clearly it would amount to a breach of professional conduct required in 
Clauses 6.13 & 10.18 and tentative possibility of NC report would be 
converted into DP and discontinuation from these programmes will take 
place as provided in these clauses. However when Dean PS/Dean WILP is 
satisfied that the tentative proposal of NC does not amount to invocation 
of this clause, he/she will cause registration in these courses to be revised 
by reporting RRA and thus requiring the student to register again in the 
same. 
(f) If a student is reported NC in a project type course, it will be administratively 
converted to RC by Dean, AUGS/AGSR and future registration in project 
courses will be done only if the Dean, AUGS/AGSR is satisfied with the 
genuineness of the candidate's interest in the course. 
 
The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) will be used to describe the 
overall performance of a student in all courses in which He/she is awarded letter 
grades, since his/her entry into the Institute upto and including the latest 
semester/term as per the procedure given in this clause. It is also used for the 
declaration of division when the programme is completed. It is the weighted average 
of the grade points of all the letter grades received by the student from his/her entry 
into the Institute and is computed as follows: 
4.21 
CGPA = u g
u g
u g
u g

where u1, u2, u3, … un denote units associated with the courses taken by the student 
and   g1, g2, g3 … gn denote grade points of the letter grades awarded in the respective 
courses. Since multiple performance in a course in which the student has already 
received a grade is possible, whenever through such a process a new grade is 
obtained, it will replace the earlier one in the calculation of CGPA. On the other hand, 
if through this process merely a report emerges, this event by itself will not alter the 
CGPA. A first degree student pursuing a minor program will be awarded an 
additional CGPA specifically for the minor program. This will not affect the inclusion 
of the grades of the courses related to the minor program in the calculation of the 
CGPA for the student in the degree program(s) He/she is enrolled in. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A student's grades, reports, CGPA, etc. at the end of every semester/term will 
be recorded on a grade sheet, a copy of which will be issued to him/her (see 1.12). 
The grade sheet will be withheld when a student has not paid his/her dues or when 
there is a pending case of breach of discipline or a case of unfair means against 
him/her. 
4.22 
The instructor-in-charge is also responsible for maintaining the full records of 
each student's attendance, performance in different components of evaluation, 
section/ class average, mid-semester grading, copies of question papers, and any 
record of evaluation that were not returned to the students. Such records should be 
maintained for at least two semesters after completion of the course. The instructor-
in-charge is also required to submit to Dean, AUGS (if courses are offered for first 
degree programmes) or Dean, AGSR (if courses are offered for higher degree 
programmes) for permanent record in the Institute a requisite number of copies of all 
4.23 
 
27 
question papers and all hand-outs (see 4.04) given to the students. By the same token, 
the convener of the respective DRC will forward to the Dean, AGSR the question 
papers of the Ph.D. Qualifying Examinations together with connected course content 
given to the students. If scrutiny or statistical analysis becomes necessary the above 
records and any other pertinent information should be made available by the 
instructor-in-charge of the course. 
In a flexible system designed to give the responsibility to the student and which 
authorises certain Deans/Associate Deans to monitor this system, it is not practical to 
write rules as to how the individual teacher should play his/her own role. The 
teacher's role must always remain active. It is only he/she who can detect incipient 
problems and identify great promise. Moreover, there are several courses like Thesis, 
Seminar, etc. where the structuring of the operation is open-ended. Whenever found 
necessary, individual teachers may send their recommendations to the appropriate 
Dean/Associate Dean suggesting changes as provided by these regulations in the 
registration of a student. 
4.24 
The content and contours of certain courses like PS, Thesis, Seminar, and 
Dissertation not only attempt an institute-wide meaning but they are also conducted 
and pursued in various PS stations and off-campus centres of BITS as well as outside 
these. In order to achieve the unusual educational thrust as well as maintain PS 
interfacing with the world outside the campus, these regulations provide that Dean 
PS will be the instructor-in-charge for all PS courses and Dean WILP for all M.E. 
(Collaborative)/M.Phil. (Applied)/off-campus programmes.  Associate Dean AUGS 
of respective Campuses will be the instructor-in-charge for First Degree Thesis 
whereas Associate Dean AGSR of respective Campuses will be the instructor-in-
charge of  Dissertation, Seminar, Independent Study, and Dissertation courses. By 
the same approach, Associate Dean, AGSR is named the instructor-in-charge of all 
Teaching Practice, Practice Lecture Series, Reading Course, Study in Advanced 
Topics, Research Practice, Research Methodology I and Research Methodology  II 
courses which are conceived and operated in such a way that the student gets a 
practical experience in the art of teaching and communication. 
4.25 
Associate Dean, AUGS/AGSR of respective Campuses has the responsibility 
for the offering of appropriate courses in a semester, for scheduling of examinations, 
and for an overall monitoring to ensure the effective fulfillment of the contract 
envisaged in these regulations between the teacher and the taught in each course. 
Associate Dean, AUGS/AGSR, has further, the discretionary authority to devise 
acceptable procedures for obtaining a feedback from teachers as well as students 
about the status and progress of a course. 
4.26 
To ensure proper and full coverage of the syllabus, the date of late registration 
of a student as well as the date of departure of a Ph.D. student before the completion 
of the semester, even when permissible under these regulations, would have to be 
fixed with the prior concurrence of Dean, AUGS/AGSR. 
4.27 
5. Minimum Academic Requirements 
 
The educational philosophy of the Institute interlinks and at the same time 
distinguishes between the performance of a student in a single course and his/her 
overall cumulative performance. Accordingly, the expected minimum academic 
5.01 
 
28 
requirements for the integrated first degree programmes and the higher degree 
programmes are described in clause 5.02 of this section. The corresponding 
requirements for the Ph.D. programme are to be inferred from the clause 8.35. 
While the Doctoral Counselling Committee (DCC) deals with the defaulting 
students in the third tier (see clause 8.38), students in the first two tiers are placed 
under the direct academic supervision, control and tutelage of the Academic 
Counselling Board (ACB), consisting of Associate Dean, AUGS (Chairman), 
Associate Dean, AGSR, Associate Dean, Student Welfare, two faculty members 
and two students nominated by the Senate. The ACB takes immediate charge of 
such a student and requires him/her to follow a specific path so that he/she could 
be rehabilitated at the earliest. Failing the efforts that are described in the 
succeeding Clauses of this section, the student would be required by ACB to leave 
the Institute. It should be understood that ACB which has, over the years, 
developed various internal procedures and techniques to achieve the objective of 
steering the student out of ACB, is not necessarily bound by the procedures of the 
past and would continue to innovate in order to maintain academic standards of the 
Institute and arrive at a quickest method by which the student either meets its 
rigours or leaves the Institute. 
At the end of every semester/term the following minimum academic standards 
have to be achieved by the students in various programmes: 
5.02 
(i) A student should not have secured more than one ‘E’ grade in the case of 
integrated first degree/first level diploma and any ‘E’ grade in the case of 
higher degree/higher level diploma, in that semester. 
 
(ii) A student should have CGPA of at least 4.50 in the case of integrated first 
degree/first level diploma and at least 5.50 in the case of higher 
degree/higher level diploma. 
 
(iii) A student should have at least cleared as per his/her latest performance, 
such courses (counted from the point of his/her entry into the Institute) as 
are prescribed for a period that corresponds to two-thirds of the number of 
semesters spent by him/her since his/her entry into the Institute with 
reference to his/her current programme. This means that at any stage of 
reckoning the student should not have spent more than 50% extra time than 
what is prescribed for him upto that stage. 
(iv) While a minor program is optional for a student and a student who is 
admitted to a minor program may graduate without completing the same, 
the completion of a minor program requires the student to maintain a 
minimum CGPA of 4.5 in the courses applied to the minor. 
 
The requirements (i), (ii) & (iii) of clause 5.02 above are minimum 
requirements that every student should meet at the end of every semester. Failure 
to meet even one of these requirements is called ‘an affliction’. One or more of 
these afflictions will automatically bring him under the purview of ACB or a 
designated authority. During the pendency of this purview, the student will lose all 
his/her options in regard to the various features permitted during the process of 
registration, namely, option of naming courses, choice of courses under electives, 
repetition of courses, taking a higher level course, a departure from the normal, 
etc.; and will also lose all his/her options for an amendment to his/her original 
5.03 
 
29 
registration namely, substitution and withdrawal. However, ACB will be fully in 
its rights to revise the original registration at any time during the semester. Indeed, 
his/her entire semester courses will be determined by ACB and will have to be 
followed to the satisfaction of ACB. If his/her performance in the course package 
prescribed by ACB in each semester suffers from NC report or lacks the efforts to 
remove the affliction(s) of clause 5.02 for which He/she came under the purview 
of ACB, it would be construed that He/she is not working to the satisfaction of 
ACB. It should be his/her single minded objective to fulfil the requirements of 
clause 5.08 thus enabling himself/herself to go outside the purview of ACB. 
(a) Recognising that the student comes under the purview of ACB on account 
of one or more afflictions of clause 5.02, ACB is charged with the 
responsibility to steer him/her out of ACB. The minimum conditions for 
this will be fulfilled whenever application of clause 5.02 shows in a future 
semester that the student no longer suffers from any of the disabling 
conditions of clause 5.02. This however, will be the minimum 
requirement. ACB may prescribe more than the minimum requirement as 
permitted in clause 5.08 (also see 5.04(c) below). It is obvious that ACB 
will be burdened with cases which may not only combine all the three 
disabling conditions of clause 5.02, but also be burdened with heavy 
backlog. Thus, ACB will have to prepare tailor-made remedies for each 
case or a set of similar cases. It is to be clarified that ACB creates no new 
regulations nor prescribes special PSC. ACB still functions within the 
broad confines of these regulations and for registration of a student in each 
semester during the pendency of the student's purview under ACB, draws 
its general authority from section 3 with special guidance from 
clauses 3.25 I, II and III. To act with promptness and to meet certain 
specific minimum goals, ACB is freed from the restriction of following the 
sequence and the special tags attached to courses in clause 3.25. In this 
context, therefore, the familiar terminology such as backlog, higher level 
courses, repetition of courses, under-loading or over-loading, etc. will lose 
their usual meanings. 
5.04 
(b) ACB will estimate the degree by which a student falls short of the 
minimum academic requirements of clause 5.02, will draw a time frame 
(i.e. number of semesters), determine a package of courses for his/her 
registration in each of the semesters and a specific task to be fulfilled in 
each semester within the time frame and lay down necessary stipulations. 
If it so happens that a summer course becomes available ACB will also 
have the power to require a student to register during the summer term to 
ease the pressure partially. 
 
(c) While the minimum academic standard as per clause 5.02 is monitored at 
the end of each semester, the requirement of graduation as enunciated in 
clause 9.01 monitors an up-to-date integrated performance from the 
beginning, and it is possible for a particular student to seemingly fulfil 
clause 9.01 but have failed to meet the requirements of clause 5.02 (i) at 
the end of a particular semester and thus come under the purview of ACB. 
ACB is authorised to review the entire history of the academic record of 
such a student and either declare him/her immediately out of its purview 
 
 
30 
to facilitate operation of clause 9.01 and clause 9.03 or retain him/her 
further under its purview. 
(d) Since the only objective of ACB is to steer the student out of ACB, neither 
the student's sojourn in ACB nor the responsibility of ACB towards the 
student can be confused with any other ambition on either side. 
 
(e) Whenever a student falls into the habit of going in and out of ACB at 
frequent intervals or when a student has given an evidence of perpetual 
misadventure, ACB will keep him/her under its purview, if necessary, for 
even a longer time than it would otherwise keep him/her. 
 
(f) For each student under its purview ACB will pronounce the number of 
semesters within which afflictions are to be removed and additional 
requirements, if any, are to be fulfilled; name the courses that He/she has 
to take in each semester to the extent it is possible to do so ahead of time; 
and lay down necessary stipulations for achieving intermediate targets 
after each semester. When once the specific tasks have been so spelt out, 
the student should fulfil these to the satisfaction of ACB. ACB will assess 
at the end of each semester the student's progress towards the twin 
objectives of overcoming the affliction of clause 5.02 which brought 
him/her into ACB and at the same time not falling into other disabling 
provisions of clause 5.02. ACB will also measure the extent to which the 
student is making progress towards the ultimate goal. If it is discovered 
that the student is not reaching the intermediate targets set for him/her even 
at the end of the first semester under the purview of ACB, ACB is 
authorised to completely jettison the earlier declared plan of action, 
reassess the situation and give only one more semester as a final semester. 
At the end of this semester either He/she should come through and re-
establish his/her credibility or, in the alternate situation of his/her 
remaining unresponsive, He/she will be required by ACB to leave the 
Institute. 
 
(g) ACB may propose entirely at its own discretion as an alternative to leaving 
the Institute, a transfer to a programme which is less exacting and which is 
less sought after; provided ACB has, before making the offer, obtained a 
prior concurrence, through timely action, of the appropriate authority who 
decides on all transfer cases, consistent with conditions attached to each 
request for transfer. 
 
(h) ACB cannot be used as a parking place by the student either to stagnate or 
to postpone the inevitable. The best use a student can make of ACB is to 
follow its instructions implicitly to rehabilitate himself/herself in his/her 
own programme, failing which seek a berth in a programme with which 
he/she can cope or leave the institute before any further loss of time. In any 
case, while He/she is in ACB he/she has simultaneously to remove his/her 
backlog, overcome the afflictions of clause 5.02 and still move forward as 
stipulated in these regulations, through a combination of operations as 
instructed by ACB. All instructions of ACB must be taken as conditions to 
continue in the Institute in order to fulfil the task within the semesters 
assigned for the purpose. ACB will be under no obligation to either lay 
 
 
31 
 
 
down any probationary condition or to obtain a written guarantee. Every 
instruction, stipulation and condition laid down from the first day would 
be binding. 
ACB consistent with the basic principles of these regulations and policies 
enunciated in clauses 5.01 to 5.04 can devise internal procedures of its own; but in 
the overall interest of the student and academic standards of the Institute, ACB will 
have to come to concrete decisions without undue loss of time or without a prior 
obligation to go through a sequence of steps. In order to meet these objectives ACB 
may use the instruments of revision of registration, if and when required, even 
sometimes after the grades are awarded. 
5.05 
If however the student is not responsive to the efforts of ACB, ACB is 
authorised to require the student to discontinue from the Institute. 
5.06 
To be effective, ACB will need the necessary time in order to establish proper 
coordinates with the student and his/her teachers. Therefore, the mere fact that 
ACB has not been able to counsel or act before the date of registration does not 
preclude it from intervening after registration. 
5.07 
Once a student has been placed under the purview of ACB, He/she would 
continue to be under its direct guidance until ACB, after being satisfied with his/her 
overall progress and performance, declares him/her to be outside its purview. 
5.08 
All decisions of ACB shall be final. 
5.09 
As far as the minimum academic requirements of the Ph.D. programmes are 
concerned, refer to clause 8.35. 
5.10 
As far as the minimum required academic standard and the academic monitoring 
of students of Off-campus, Work Integrated Learning and Collaborative Programmes 
are concerned, refer also to clauses 10.24 and 10.25. 
5.11 
6. Some Special Courses and Programmes 
 
To capture a special educational flavour and goals of the various programmes 
the structures provide for certain courses which must be pursued only after certain 
academic base has been achieved. To ensure these objectives, the registration and 
operation of these courses are to be specially regulated. While the features, of these 
regulatory procedures are described in the following Clauses, it is to be noted at 
this stage that these courses and programmes have not only been a hallmark of the 
Institute’s innovative thrust but they diligently span the campus and the 
professional world. Therefore, apart from the routine operation, even though 
unusual, a theme and vision have to be continuously nurtured and expanded to meet 
this unusual challenge and responsibility. Dean PS  is overall in-charge for Practice 
School courses and will cause all that has to be done within the framework of these 
regulations to sustain and move further in these tasks. Dean WILP is in-charge of 
all off-campus Programmes (see section 10 for details). Similarly, Dean/Associate 
Dean AGSR who is in-charge of Thesis-Seminar, Dissertation will make all efforts  
to  move into mission-oriented interdisciplinary research of national relevance 
conducted in the campus as well as outside the campus and take all necessary steps 
to give meaning and shape to the Institute's vision. 
6.01 
 
32 
(a) Practice School Courses 
 
PS and TS are alternative options available in the integrated first degree 
programmes and PS and dissertation are alternative options in the higher degree 
programmes. The PS option of integrated first degree programmes consists of two 
courses PS I and PS II. These courses form a controlled simulation of the real life 
whereby the circumstance of a link with environment is created. They require that 
students undergo the rigour of the professional world in form as well as substance, 
thus providing them an opportunity to apply their class-room knowledge to live 
situations. 
6.02 
In all PS courses also the concept of continuous evaluation enunciated in clause 
4.05 will be followed. Since the educational processes in the PS courses seek out and 
focus attention on many latent attributes which do not surface in the normal class-
room situation, the process of evaluation in the PS courses should be designed with 
care so that information on a continuous basis on the following attributes becomes 
available: intellectual ability; team work; leadership; initiative; personality; 
professional judgment; common sense; problem solving ability; sense of 
responsibility; decision making ability; art of guestimation; punctuality; ability to 
meet deadlines; ability to communicate through oral and written presentations; etc. 
6.03 
Each student will also be given at the time of graduation a Practice School 
Transcript which contains, among other things, a rating sheet summarising the 
assessment of the student's professional personality obtained by the above process by 
the PS faculty resident at the practice station. 
6.04 
PS I can be taken by a student of first degree programme normally after prior 
preparation visualised in the Bulletin. PS II, however, can be taken by such a student 
only after all named courses (including PS I) of the programme have been cleared. 
Regarding the prior preparation for PS I and PS II in the dual degree schemes, and 
PS for higher degree programmes see clause 3.14. 
6.05 
While registering for any PS course no student can simultaneously register in 
any other course. 
6.06 
The normal duration of PS-I is about 8 weeks and PS-II (or PS for HD students) 
is about 22 weeks. Since the duration of each of these PS components is closely 
intertwined with various practical difficulties including the dynamics of the business 
in the practice school stations, the actual duration, starting and ending dates are 
worked out within the above broad guidelines taking all aspects into account in each 
academic year. To accommodate these durations of the practice school components, 
a substantial portion of the summer term of the academic year is utilized along with 
the semester time. Hence, it is the responsibility of the students with PS option to 
make himself/herself available for PS-I/PS-II strictly as per the starting and ending 
dates prescribed in the calendar for each academic year, failing which he/she may be 
moved out of the PS option. The decision of the Dean PS is final in this matter.   
6.06a 
Dean PS has the authority to assign PS courses appropriate term/semesters at 
various PS stations. Even when He/she asks for options and choices from the students 
his/her decision in these matters shall be final. 
6.07 
In view of many practical difficulties Dean PS is further authorised to 
advance/delay PS I by one year just as he/she has the authority to advance/delay 
6.08 
 
33 
PS II by one semester as seen from the point of view of a particular student. But 
acting within his/her authority Dean PS will have to take note of the fact that a 
specific prior preparation for the Core Courses is prescribed for PS option which 
includes PS I. Thus when he/she delays PS I, he/she may have to simultaneously 
authorise that the counting of the prior preparation in the case of Core Courses in 
such a case would not include PS I. Likewise, to accommodate admission with 
advanced standing with PS option or a late transfer into the PS option, Dean PS 
may have to give the same dispensation. If delay of PSI/PSII occurs due to student's 
own inability to follow up on the allotment because of illness or any such genuine 
reason then, while the same dispensation as above can be given by the Dean PS, 
He/she may also take this case separately, if the situation so warrants, in the further 
allotment procedure. 
If a student disregards the allotment of any PS course at the time made by Dean 
PS for him/her, He/she may forfeit the PS option entirely. The consequential effect 
of such an event will be to seek transfer to Thesis/Dissertation option as the case may 
be. 
6.09 
In view of the preponderance of the PS option, all students admitted to the 
various integrated first degree and higher degree programmes may be allotted to this 
option. Any student of the integrated first degree, however, is free to move out of this 
option and seek, from Dean PS, a transfer to the Thesis option before he/she is allotted 
a seat in PS I. If a higher degree student wants to move out of the PS option, he/she 
should seek the transfer no later than the completion of the first semester of his/her 
degree programme, through Dean PS. Once Dean PS gives his/her permission, the 
case will be referred to Dean/Associate Dean, AUGS (first degree case) or 
Dean/Associate Dean AGSR (higher degree case) for transfer to the 
Thesis/Dissertation option. The usual rules of transfer will operate (see section 7(d)). 
The decision of Dean PS in this matter will be final. 
6.10 
If a student wants to move out of the PS option after attending PS I, He/she 
should seek the transfer not later than the completion of one semester after PS I, 
through Dean PS. After the above date, it would normally not be possible for a student 
to seek such a transfer except where Dean PS agrees to the transfer in view of 
extenuating circumstances. 
6.11 
A student who has once opted out of the PS option should not expect automatic 
permission to get back to the PS option at a later stage unless He/she satisfies Dean 
PS that these actions of opting out and seeking to opt in are based on bonafide 
reasons. 
6.12 
Since the PS programme interfaces with the world outside the campus and is 
heavily committed, whenever the progress of a student in any PS course is found 
unsatisfactory and his/her conduct unworthy of the professional world, He/she may 
be required to discontinue from his/her programme with PS option without any 
reasons being assigned. However, He/she will be free to seek a transfer to the Thesis/ 
Dissertation option as soon as possible. His/her current registration will be cancelled 
and the grade sheet will show DP (see 4.20 (e)). 
6.13 
A dual degree student who is required to discontinue from a PS course at 
anytime will thereafter have to complete his/her degree(s) with thesis option only 
after taking necessary actions for his/her transfer to the thesis option. 
6.14 
 
34 
 
(b) Thesis-Seminar, Dissertation, Project Work, Project, Design Project 
 
Before registration in Thesis a student must complete the prior preparation 
which differs from tier to tier. In the first tier a single degree student must have 
cleared all named compulsory courses – this will include all named courses in 
General Institutional Requirement and all Discipline Core courses. Regarding the 
registration in Thesis for students in the dual degree schemes see clause 3.14. In the 
second tier a student should normally have cleared all other courses before He/she 
registers in Dissertation. In the third tier He/she should have completed the 
requirement of clause 8.13. 
6.15 
(a) 
A Ph.D. student registering in Thesis cannot be simultaneously registered in 
any other course; this rule will apply even when a student is registered in the 
Thesis course or the Seminar course in the decoupled situation of clause 6.17. 
Exceptions to this rule are the  courses mentioned in clauses 8.08& 8.10, 
applicable to Ph.D. students 
6.16 
(b) 
Concurrent registration in Higher Degree Dissertation with appropriate 
number of units for higher degree along with other courses may be permitted 
by DCA of the Department concerned. (see clause 1.08(a)). In specific cases 
of Higher Degree programs, Dissertation with an extended duration is 
explicitly mentioned in the semester-wise chart for the program. In such cases 
students may opt for the same wherein coursework requirement may be 
reduced (in number of courses and units) as per the chart in compensation for 
increased units for Dissertation as stated in the chart for the program. However 
such a decision should be made by the student in the semester prior to the start 
of the Dissertation in concurrence with the supervisor(s) of the Dissertation 
and the Head of the Department. Concurrent coursework may be permitted 
during Dissertation only as stated in the chart for the program. 
(c) 
A first degree student opting for a Thesis has two options: (i) register for a 16-
units Thesis, in which case the student cannot be simultaneously registered in 
any other course; or (ii) register for a 9-units Thesis, in which the case it may 
be necessary for the student to take additional elective courses to meet 
graduation requirements (see clause 6.16(d)) and He/she may be permitted to 
register in courses simultaneously with the Thesis (see clause 6.16(e)). 
(d) 
Graduation requirements for a first degree student includes Thesis (16 units) 
or Practice School I (5 units) and Practice School II (20 units) for each program 
the student is pursuing. (i) If a single degree student opts for a 9-units Thesis, 
he/she must complete at least 2 additional elective courses (of at least 6 units) 
to meet graduation requirements i.e. the Open Electives requirement of such 
student  is assumed to have increased to at least 7 courses and at least 21 units. 
If such a student pursuing a 9-units Thesis has completed PS-I, the PS-I course 
and the corresponding units may be accounted towards the modified Open 
Electives requirement. (ii) If a dual degree student opts for a 9-units Thesis for 
either one of the two degrees, the modified Open Electives requirement would 
apply. And as the discipline electives requirement of either degree is accounted 
as open electives for the other degree in a dual degree program, the student 
 
 
35 
would be deemed to have satisfied the modified Open Electives requirement if 
the total number and units of discipline electives from the two programs 
exceed 7 courses and 21 units respectively; if not the student may have to 
complete additional electives to complete this modified requirement. Of 
course, if a dual degree student is opting for PS-II in neither of his two degrees 
but has completed PS-I, He/she may account the PS-I course and the 
corresponding units towards the modified Open Electives requirement stated 
above.  (iii) If a dual degree student opts for a 9-units Thesis for each of the 
two degrees He/she is pursuing the Open Electives requirement would be 
assumed as at least 9 courses and at least 27 units; And the student would be 
deemed to have satisfied the modified Open Electives requirement if the total 
number and units of discipline electives from the two programs and those of 
PS-I (if completed) exceed 9 courses and 27 units respectively. 
(e) 
A first degree student registered in a 9-units Thesis may be permitted to 
simultaneously register in at most 3 courses of at most 9 units total. Such 
courses are normally accounted under Open Electives category. 
Thesis and Seminar courses are permitted to be decoupled in the following 
situations: 
6.17 
(i) 
when, his/her thesis and Seminar get separated because of the operation of 
consequential action of NC report on one of them while there is no need to 
register in the other (see 4.20 (d)); 
 
(ii) 
when, in the case of a Ph.D. student, he is required to register in Seminar even 
before he is allowed to register in the Thesis course (see 8.16 (b)); 
 
(iii) When, in the case of a Ph.D. student, he/she has been specially permitted to 
register during the summer term. 
 
Whenever a programme does not visualise Thesis or Seminar to be time 
bound, the time schedule is made elastic until the original tasks in these courses are 
completed. In such a situation, after the units attached to each course have been 
fulfilled the student will register in these courses for units as per clauses 8.16 (b) & 
8.22. 
6.18 
When Dean/Associate Dean, AGSR is satisfied that the organisation of the 
Seminar is not feasible, the student will register in Independent Study in lieu of 
Seminar for the same number of units. 
6.19 
 
In the first two tiers, a student is assigned a topic of research as well as his/her 
supervisor by DCA giving due consideration to the student's preference, the research 
goals of the Institute, and the equalisation of the work load of the supervisors. The 
decision of Dean, AUGS (first degree thesis case) and Dean, AGSR (higher degree 
dissertation case) shall be final.  
6.20 
While the student has to be in residence throughout the duration of the 
programme on the campus, Dean, AUGS/AGSR may, however, require him/her to 
do part or whole of his/her thesis course at any off- campus centres. However, a 
supervisor of the candidate must be from the Institute. 
6.21 
 
For the purpose of these regulations, the thesis/dissertation is defined as a 
coherent document that embodies the investigations on the completion of the work 
6.22 
 
36 
and which has been prepared with the approval of the supervisor and which is ready 
for submission to the examiners. In the first two tiers, the student must submit to 
DCA, two typed copies of his/her thesis/dissertation (along with its soft copy) which 
should also incorporate a certificate from his/her supervisor stating that the work has 
been completed to the satisfaction of the supervisor. The thesis must be written in 
English. For submission of the thesis in the third tier and for the language in which it 
should be written see clauses 8.12. 
The Thesis/Dissertation course in the first two tiers are visualised to be a time 
bound activity and must coterminate with the successful completion of the assigned 
units. The submission of thesis/dissertation must take place within the prescribed 
time failing which, the registration in the last course will be cancelled and his/her 
grade sheet will show RRA against the course. A student will be required to register 
for the same number of units in the thesis course for which the registration was 
cancelled (see 4.18) and for the dissertation course the number of units will be 
decided by DCA. 
6.23 
 
For the purpose of evaluating the thesis/dissertation in the first two tiers, DCA 
will appoint a panel of examiners (not exceeding two) of which the supervisor will 
be one member. This panel will examine the thesis/dissertation, conduct the viva and 
recommend a grade as prescribed in these regulations within the specified time. For 
the third tier see clauses 8.28 to 8.34. 
6.24 
 
For details of operation of Ph.D. Thesis also consult Section 8 of these 
Regulations. 
6.25 
7. Flexibilities 
 
The various educational programmes of the Institute are distinguished by 
structural and operational flexibilities to meet as far as possible many worthy goals 
in a practical way. These regulations make an attempt to convert the concept of 
flexibilities to reality. All these benefits are to be shared with responsibility and 
goodwill. It is therefore necessary to enumerate at least some of these flexibilities and 
describe, where necessary, the broad guidelines in their operation. These flexibilities 
are: admissions in both semesters, admission with marginal deficiency, admission 
with advanced standing, transfer, dual degree assignment, admission to a minor 
program, the option of Thesis/Practice School, electives, repetition of courses, 
amendment to original registration (withdrawal, substitution), departure from normal 
pace, auditing of courses, summer term offerings etc. These flexibilities need an 
administrative decision either through an admission process and/or a registration 
process. It is to be clarified that any transfer or dual degree assignment will be treated 
as an admission process. Enjoyment of a flexibility involves acceptance of a 
responsibility both by the recipient as well as by the donor. This contract must be 
understood if the system with these unique features is to continue to serve the student 
and the educational system. 
7.01 
However, when a student who is under the purview of ACB becomes a 
candidate for any of the flexibilities such as dual degree and transfer, the Chairman 
of ACB will be requested for a full report on the student together with useful 
comments, before the case is processed for award of the flexibility, irrespective of 
7.02 
 
37 
the fact that the student might have been promised such a flexibility at the time of 
admission. While this promise, if any, will certainly be redeemed, the actual 
implementation of the flexibility may have to be delayed in order for the student to 
improve his/her academic standing to cope with the additional burden. 
The various flexibilities are permitted to be worked out on the basis of broad as 
well as detailed conditions presented in these regulations as well as in the Bulletin. 
After implementing these flexibilities, the actions will be reported to the Senate 
specially in connection with admission with advanced standing, admission with 
marginal deficiency, special type of admission in the Ph.D. programmes, award of 
dual degree programme, decisions on transfers, outcome of ACB actions, offerings 
of summer courses, etc. 
7.03 
 (a) Admissions in both semesters 
 
The Institute makes admission in both the semesters depending upon 
availability of seats and facilities. In the case of first tier of the formal system the bulk 
of admissions are made in the first semester. In view of the available structural 
flexibilities it may be possible to accommodate a small number of equally 
competitive students in the second semester also, thus making feasible a unique 
feature of the Institute, namely, admission in the second semester. But there is no 
guarantee that second semester admissions will always be made. 
7.04 
(b) Summer Term 
 
As already emphasized in clause 1.02, the only obligation the Institute can 
recognise during the summer months is to conduct PS and other such courses 
shown in semester wise pattern, Internship for students who had fulfilled the prior 
preparation to register in the same. Even in the discharge of this responsibility the 
Institute has to engage a large number of teachers who are detained for summer 
duty to meet the commitments of the above courses conducted in various parts of 
the country. 
7.05 
However, by further stretching all resources and by a great imposition on 
teachers, the Institute has been disposed towards accommodating under certain 
conditions, through summer term, few courses for the benefits of students 
(see 1.03) may be able to graduate in that summer term. Since overtaxed resources 
have been already stretched, the Institute will have to ensure that proper use of the 
summer term is made by these students. Even these courses will be cancelled if the 
clientele for which these courses were offered withdrew later. Even this position 
will be continuously reviewed to ascertain whether these students ultimately will 
benefit in graduation in minimum possible time. 
7.06 
Once it has been decided, under the above limited voluntary gesture, to offer a 
set of summer courses, the students outside the above clientele may also be permitted 
to register in these courses provided the conditions of registration as prescribed in 
these regulations can be fulfilled by them for any of the courses thus being offered. 
In this connection it is to be clarified that during the summer term no entity called 
(PSC) or (OPSC) exists. By the same token backlog cannot be expressed in terms of 
(OBL). All backlog has to be only expressed in terms of (BL). However, if backlog 
courses are available the rule regarding (BL) being the first charge will apply. It is 
also to be remembered that the offering of these courses has been purely fortuitous 
so far as the other students are concerned and also that they can take only upto three 
7.07 
 
38 
courses. Such a student can register in these courses as a repeat or as a backlog. If the 
course happens to be a higher level course for a student, He/she can register in it only 
if He/she had no backlog at the end of the previous semester or He/she had only one 
backlog which He/she is able to register concurrently with the higher level course in 
the summer term. Further any amendment to the original registration can be 
(see 3.26) only done provided subsequent registration continues to be consistent with 
the above enunciation. 
While these regulations do not stipulate that a Ph.D. student must register during 
the summer term, it is really his/her own necessity to so register for purposes of full 
enjoyment of his/her fellowship. While being sympathetic to this need of the student, 
the particular course(s) in which He/she will register in the summer term will be 
entirely at the discretion of  Dean AGSR, consistent with the provisions of these 
regulations. 
7.08 
Consistent with what has been stated above, the Institute will be free to amend 
the procedure for voluntary offerings of courses during the summer term from time 
to time. 
7.09 
(c) Dual Degree Scheme 
 
These regulations provide an unusual opportunity to students who are capable 
of accepting the challenge to work simultaneously for two degrees out of the 
integrated first degree programmes, subject to the structural harmony defined in 
terms of Groups of programmes (see 2.02 & 2.03), subject to the Institute's 
announcements from time to time and subject also to the fact that dual degree is a 
competitive admission process. Once a student is admitted to the dual degree 
scheme his/her semester wise pattern for the single degree will be replaced by 
another semester wise pattern which is composite but unique to the specific 
combination of the two programmes. 
7.10 
The principle by which the composite programme is worked out is described 
thus. The General Institutional Requirement and two sets of the Discipline 
requirement (one for each of the two programmes) constitute the basic requirement 
of the composite programme. On this basic requirement is superimposed the PS 
and TS requirement for the two programs. All these courses are now properly 
interspersed and resequenced to form the dual degree programme. Thus in every 
dual degree scheme normally one degree would be with PS and the other with TS. 
However, if a student of the dual degree programmes wishes to do PS for the 
second degree also, the PS Division may accommodate his/her request, if feasible, 
after accommodating all students doing PS for the first time. As a logical 
consequence a student may be allowed to do both degrees with thesis. The Open 
Electives requirement is considered to be subsumed by the combination of the two 
sets of Discipline Electives. 
7.11 
The dual degree composite programme contains, among the compulsory 
courses, PS, TS (or both PS or both TS as per clause 7.11), all General Institutional 
Requirement courses excluding Humanities Electives, and the union of Discipline 
Core courses for the two degrees. Thus courses common (or courses marked 
equivalent) between the two sets of Discipline Core courses need be completed only 
once by the student. Clauses 3.14 and 3.15 prescribe a prior preparation required 
before a student can take any of these courses (see 2.03). A student in the dual degree 
7.12 
 
39 
composite programme cannot account a Discipline Core course of one his/her 
degrees as a Discipline elective for the other degree; He/she cannot account any 
course as a Discipline elective course in two disciplines.  
The student in the dual degree would be free to make a request to which 
degree He/she wishes to attach the PS component in order to call it a PS degree 
and to which He/she wishes to attach the Thesis component. This option must 
be expressed immediately after the completion of PS I but not later than the end 
of one semester after PS I. If the student neglects to take this advance action 
Dean PS will draw up the linkage. The decision of Dean PS shall be final. 
However, this attachment selected by the student or assigned by the Dean must 
conform to the basic condition that TS or PS II of either of the two degrees in 
the composite programme must be done only after the corresponding Core 
Course(s) of the same degree has been cleared. It is to be noted that whenever a 
student has been unable to clear PS I at the appointed time, it may become too 
late for him/her to exercise this option and the allocation of PS and TS will be 
contingent on his/her ability to complete the prior preparation for these courses. 
7.13 
It would be obvious from clause 7.11 that the composite programme in the dual 
degree scheme cannot be separately completed for each degree. Thus only when a 
student has completed the entire composite programme He/she fulfils the 
requirements of graduation for the two degrees in the scheme. Consequently the 
divisions awarded for these two degrees would be the same. 
7.14 
Once a dual degree permission has been given the student must work according 
to the scheme and semester wise pattern applicable to the particular dual degree 
combination. For the frequently occurring combinations of dual degree scheme, the 
semester-wise patterns are given in the Bulletin. Any willful departure from the 
scheme without prior permission from Dean AUGS may entail the cancellation of 
the dual degree facility. In such a case the student will be transferred back to his/her 
first degree. (see also 6.14) 
7.15 
For a student in the dual degree scheme, transfer of first or second degree from 
one discipline to another discipline on a competitive basis is possible keeping in mind 
the overall educational objectives. 
7.16(a) 
A student in the dual degree scheme is not allowed to drop the first degree and 
do only the second degree. 
7.16(b) 
If a student admitted to the dual degree scheme is unable to proceed with it for 
any valid reason he/she may submit a written application to Dean AUGS for 
withdrawal from the dual degree scheme. If his/her request is granted his/her case 
will be dealt with as a transfer from the dual degree scheme back to the scheme of 
his/her first degree, subject to current structure and regulations. 
7.16(c) 
Whenever a transfer from dual degree to a single degree as visualised in 
clauses 7.15 and 7.16 takes place after the student has already exercised his/her 
option visualised in clause 7.13, for the purpose of determining the eligibility for the 
first degree either the PS option or the TS option may be accepted irrespective of 
earlier declaration by the student. 
7.17 
(d) Transfer 
 
The flexibilities of the system provide for transfer which is a movement of the 
7.18 
 
40 
student from one goal to another before completion of the first. In actual practice, 
subject to stipulations given in the Bulletin, the structure provides for a transfer from: 
one programme to another within the same tier; one optional stream to another within 
the same tier (PS option to Thesis/Dissertation option and vice versa); one scheme to 
another within the same tier (dual degree scheme to single degree scheme); a 
programme in one tier to a programme in a higher tier or its reverse (see 8.33, 8.34, 
8.35 & 8.36). Transfer is operated only at the beginning of a semester except where 
otherwise provided. 
At the point of transfer the student's entire academic record is scrutinised and 
the additional courses He/she has to clear after the transfer are determined in the 
following manner: 
7.19 
(i) Out of the courses taken by the student as per his/her academic record, 
those courses which He/she has already cleared as of the latest 
performance will form the set called the ‘course-mix’ from the past. The 
set of the remaining courses for which there is a performance will be 
called the ‘residual-mix’ from the past. The courses of the course-mix as 
well as those of the residual-mix will now be stripped of any category 
tag under which they might have been taken. The new programme to 
which He/she is transferred would have an eligibility sheet which lists 
all the courses pertaining to that programme in terms of named 
compulsory courses and elective slots. All the courses in the course-mix 
will now be exhausted, by allotting them to the new programme in 
appropriate categories, that is, either in the named category or in the 
elective category. The residual-mix will be booked for the new 
programme only against the required named compulsory courses of the 
new programme. However the residual-mix may be booked for elective 
of the new programme at the point of transfer at the option of the student. 
Once all this exercise is completed the courses left in the course-mix 
together with courses left in the residual-mix will now be referred to as 
the set of unaccounted courses. Among the unaccounted courses the 
courses with grades or with NC reports will then be completely frozen 
as long as the student continues in the new programme or graduates in 
the new programme. In other words they cannot be booked for any future 
necessity in the new programme nor can they be repeated. However if an 
unaccounted course has a latest performance which is a report other than 
NC, it will not be frozen and it may be allowed to be booked against a 
future necessity for an elective slot, if any, in the new programme. 
 
(ii) In the matter of booking the courses the student will have the option to 
name a course from the course-mix of the past against the elective slot 
in the new programme; it should be obvious that He/she has no other 
option. 
 
(iii) Further his/her entire up-to-date scholastic record including CGPA is 
carried over at the point of transfer. Any previous event which 
constitutes part of the sanctions of eligibility of the new situation will 
now operate. It is obvious that no transfer is possible if a sanction in the 
old situation has not been properly disposed of. 
 
 
41 
(iv) Irrespective of whatever has been said above, if later events justifiable 
by these regulations so warrant the student may be permitted to utilise 
for credit in future an unaccounted course cleared earlier. 
 
(v) Further, whenever a transfer is made the semester wise pattern in his/her 
new programme would be as per the current Bulletin and for all purposes 
of these academic regulations (such as 3.21 etc.) his/her date of entry 
into the Institute would mark the initial semester of his/her new 
programme. 
 
Whenever the same student undergoes more than one transfer, at each point 
of transfer the provisions stipulated for transfer must be implemented. It may be 
clarified that through a process of more than one transfer for a particular student, 
what was operative before the particular point of transfer may become inoperative 
after this event and vice versa. 
7.20 
Since admission to a programme is done on assigned and competitive basis, 
normally there may not be any scope of undoing the fact of an assigned admission 
through transfer.  However, whenever a student is not able to cope up with the 
programme for which He/she is admitted, ACB in order to salvage the student may 
recommend transfer to a suitable programme.  Transfer will always be for motivated 
students from one degree programme to another in the same tier or different tier in 
terms of limited numbers and will be on a competitive basis. 
7.21 
(e) Advanced Standing 
 
Whenever a meritorious candidate seeking admission to any programme of the 
Institute comes with a preparation higher than the minimum entrance qualification 
prescribed for the programme, He/she is considered for admission at some 
intermediate stage in this programme under the provisions called 'Admission with 
Advanced Standing'. If admission is feasible his/her previous academic record will 
be scrutinised vis-a-vis the requirements of the programme to which He/she seeks 
admission. If this exercise cannot give a firm conclusion as to which courses of the 
Institute programme He/she is to be exempted from, specially designed tests will be 
given to him/her. However, this exercise would be subject to the broad policies 
mentioned in clauses 7.23 to 7.29 below. 
7.22 
Such exemption can be entertained only in respect of courses which are a 
compulsory package of the new programme. Wherever the new programme provides 
for a package of electives this whole package has to be done at the Institute. 
7.23 
Since the programme structure of the higher degrees is different from that of 
integrated first degrees in terms of details like compulsory courses, electives, etc., the 
requirement of a student admitted with advanced standing in a higher degree 
programme will be worked out on a case by case basis by the DCA (See 1.08(a)) 
maintaining the standards of the programmes. 
7.24 
Further, whenever such an admission is made a student at the time of entry 
would notionally be placed in a nominal semester in the semester wise pattern as of 
the current Bulletin and his/her backlog courses would be correspondingly identified 
(see 3.25 I). 
7.25 
As far as the programmes of the first tier are concerned, a basic distinction has 
to be made at the entry point between candidates who possess an integrated first 
7.26 
 
42 
degree of BITS or its equivalent and those whose prior preparation is short of this. 
Remembering that the dual degree scheme of the Institute is awarded under a 
competitive situation it would not be possible to gain additional advantage by a route 
of completion of one BITS degree or its equivalent and admission with advanced 
standing for another first degree of BITS. In respect of such candidates there shall be 
no provision of taking electives more than the minimum number required nor that of 
transfer. 
7.27 
On the other hand, a candidate who at the entry point does not possess a 
University degree or possesses a University degree which is lower than the integrated 
first degree of BITS would have all the opportunities that are available for a normal 
student who enters at the starting point of the programme, subject to any restrictions 
stipulated at the time of admission. 
7.28 
For a student admitted with advanced standing into a programme the 
CGPA/division awarded to him/her at the end of the programme will be based only 
on the grades of courses taken by him/her in his/her prescribed programme at the 
Institute. 
7.29 
(f) Marginal Deficiency 
 
Whenever a brilliant candidate whose prior preparation has been marginally 
deficient in terms of stated courses/subjects seeks admission to the Institute, he/she 
may be admitted with the condition that Dean, AUGS/AGSR may require him/her 
to do additional courses over and above those prescribed for a student with normal 
preparation. It is, therefore, to be noted that such a student enters the programme with 
a backlog (see 3.25 I). 
7.30 
For a student admitted with marginal deficiency into a programme his/her 
CGPA/division will be determined on the basis of all courses prescribed in the 
programme together with such additional courses mentioned in clause 7.30. 
7.31 
(g) Audit 
 
The facility of taking a course on audit is principally conceived to give an 
opportunity to a person to update his/her knowledge. It is expected to meet primarily 
the needs of casual students (not enrolled for a degree). No degree of the Institute 
can be acquired by merely taking courses on audit or having once taken some courses 
on audit, offering these courses for credit whenever permissible in these regulations 
like advanced standing etc. In this connection definition of the word “cleared” given 
in clause 1.15 will not encompass a grade received for a course registered on audit. 
7.32 
There are certain courses amongst the offering of the Institute which are neither 
part of a programme nor are available through electives. Any student who wishes to 
take such courses can take them only on audit basis and also on payment of additional 
fees. 
7.33 
Certain courses are not, however, available on audit namely, PS, Thesis, 
Dissertation, all courses of the M.E. (Collaborative)/M.Phil. (Applied) programmes 
and other courses specifically so mentioned in the Bulletin. 
7.34 
A person who has taken a course on audit cannot, even with a 'Satisfactory' 
grade, automatically claim acceptance of that course for the fulfillment of 
requirements of any programme current or future. As and when such a person seeks 
7.35 
 
43 
admission to any degree in the Institute, if that course happens to be a required course 
in the new programme, he/she will be required to do another course in lieu of the 
same as identified by Dean AUGS/AGSR, except as specifically provided 
otherwise in Clause 8.09. 
The Institute may offer discrete specialised courses on-campus and off-campus 
on credit basis for the manpower development of a target population. A student who 
registers for such courses will be known as an associate student as against casual 
student (see clause 7.32). On the completion of a course the associate student would 
be given a certificate mentioning the grade obtained. If an associate student has 
secured valid grades in various courses in this manner, which together fulfil the 
requirements of a degree/diploma programme, he/she may, if he/she so desires, seek 
admission to the said degree/diploma programme to qualify for the same. AGC 
would finalise the operational details for such associate students. 
 
(h) Minor Programs    
Minor programmes are offered in certain areas as options for integrated first degree 
students with the intent of encouraging them to add focus to their supplemental 
learning (outside a major area) as well as recognizing and certifying the knowledge 
obtained in an area that is outside of their major area. 
A minor option would allow a student to pursue the study of an area or a sub-area 
through a set of courses but not as exhaustively as required to obtain a degree (i.e. a 
major) in that area. A student may be admitted to at most one minor program. 
A student – if he/she chooses to pursue a minor – should declare at the end of the 2nd 
year that he/she will pursue a specific minor.   
Each minor program may come with an exclusion Clause stating that students from 
certain programs are not be eligible to pursue that minor. 
While the option of a minor program is available to all first degree students, the 
Department(s) offering a minor program may stipulate additional input restrictions 
on the basis of academic performance of the student. In particular, the overall CGPA 
and/or grades in specific courses relevant to the minor program may be considered 
for admission to the minor programme. Such criteria will be stipulated by the Cross-
Campus Departmental Committee(s) for Academics for the Department(s) offering 
the minor programme.  
If and when he/she completes the requirements for the minor – as stipulated above 
and as stipulated for the specific minor, then he/she may apply for a “minor” 
certificate. If the requirements are met, then he/she will be awarded a “minor 
certificate” (separate from a degree - i.e. major - certificate). A minor certificate will 
be issued only on completion of a degree (i.e. a major) i.e. a student may graduate 
without a minor but cannot graduate without completion of a degree (i.e. major).  If 
a student declares to pursue a minor after the end of his/her 2nd year, the award of 
his/her minor programme may get delayed depending on offering of the requisite 
courses and their availability.    
Each minor program defines a minimum number of courses and a minimum number 
of units as required to complete that minor. Each minor program also defines a certain 
set of courses as core – and therefore mandatory – for that minor and a pool of 
7.36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.37 
 
 
44 
electives from which a student may choose courses to complete the requirements.  
A student may use at most one project / seminar type course to meet the elective 
requirements of a minor.  
Overlap requirements: 
• 
At most 2 courses (and at most 6 units) out of the above requirement (of 5 courses 
and 15 units) may be met by mandatory courses of the student’s degree i.e. major 
(or degrees i.e. majors): i.e. from the general institutional requirement (excluding 
Humanities requirement) or the (Major) discipline Core(s). 
• 
There is no restriction of overlap requirement on electives (i.e. discipline elective 
or open elective or humanities elective).  
• 
No course may be used to meet the requirements of two different minors nor 
may a course be used to the meet the requirements of two majors and a minor. 
8.  Additional Clauses for Ph.D. Programme 
Creation of Departmental Research Committee (DRC) 
Each Department will have a "Departmental Research Committee" (DRC), 
consisting of Head of Department (HOD) as ex-officio member and chair-person, 
and 4 to 8 faculty members, at the level of Assistant Professor and above, who are 
active in research.  The size of DRC may depend on the number of faculty members 
in the Department.  One of the members will act as its convener.  The term of DRC 
will be of two years.  DRC will be approved by the Director of the campus on the 
recommendation of HOD. 
The role of DRC will be in executing operations from admissions to final thesis 
submission that are outlined in each operation mentioned below. 
 
 
8.01 
Ph D Admissions: 
Admission to the Ph.D. programme is, in the first instance, provisional. The 
admission is formalized after the student passes his/her Qualifying Examination. The 
various components of the programme are: Course-work, Qualifying Examination, 
Foreign 
language, 
Teaching 
Practice/Practice 
Lecture 
Series/ 
Research 
Methodology, Thesis, and Seminar/Independent Study. It shall be the responsibility 
of the student to ensure, through timely actions, that he/she satisfies the requirements 
of all the components of his/her programme. Throughout the duration of the 
programme a full-time Ph.D.  student must be in full-time residence in the campus/PS 
stations and off-campus centres of the Institute or at outside centres as permissible in 
the rules. A part time Ph.D. student will visit the respective BITS Pilani campus, 
where he/she is registered for regular interaction with supervisor/co-supervisor and 
present his/her research progress. 
 
 
8.02 
Input 
 
To obtain a better understanding of the subsequent handling of cases, various 
possible inputs to the Ph.D. programme are classified according to backgrounds. 
These are: (a) the preferred input, namely, a student coming with a higher degree of 
the Institute or its equivalent; (b) a student coming after clearing all or part of the 
coursework of a higher degree of the Institute or its equivalent without completing 
8.02a 
 
45 
the degree; (c) a student who enters with an integrated first degree of the Institute or 
equivalent; (d) a student who enters the Ph.D. programme after passing Qualifying 
Examination as per clause 8.44 (e) a student, under faculty development, who enters 
the programme after passing the Qualifying Examination as per clause 8.40 (f) a 
Scientist, Engineer or professional belonging to collaborative, or other sponsoring 
organisations. (g) a person working in a reputed research organization, academic 
Institute and Industry, situated preferably in the close vicinity of one of the campuses 
of BITS Pilani, can be admitted on part time basis provided (i) the candidate is 
working in an organization which encourages and facilitates research (ii) candidate 
meets the requisite minimum qualification for admission to Ph. D programme of 
BITS Pilani as mentioned in (a), (b) or (c) (iii) candidate has minimum of one year 
work experience in related field, and (iv) candidate furnishes a "consent &no 
objection certificate"  from his/her parent organization. 
Each case once accepted would be treated under any of the above items 
consistent with his/her background.  
For each candidate admitted to Ph.D. programme, the DRC will recommend 
a notional thesis supervisor or mentor on the basis of department need and student's 
area of interest. Further, for each Ph. D student, the DRC will in consultation with 
the notional supervisor of the students, appoint two additional members for a 
Doctoral Advisory Committee (DAC). However, for student in interdisciplinary area, 
there can be DAC member(s) from other department/campuses based on Topic of 
Research. Student will be monitored by notional supervisor of the department. DAC 
may counsel the student throughout his/her programme. 
 
Course work 
For students with first degree, depending upon the student's qualification and 
background, the DRC will, in consultation with the student's notional supervisor and 
DAC members, prescribe course work. The minimum number of courses shall be six 
with minimum of 24 units. Candidate should not obtain less than D grade in any 
course and should have minimum CGPA of 5.50.  If less than D grade is obtained, 
course should be repeated.  On obtaining less than D grade in more than one course 
or CGPA less than 5.50, and if the student fails to bring it up to 5.50 within two 
subsequent semesters, student shall be discontinued from the programme. 
Students with Higher Degree may also be required to do course work if he/she is 
working in different area than his/her area of Higher Degree or having less than 6 
courses in his/her Higher Degree. Number of courses will be decided by the notional 
Supervisor and DRC members in order to prepare the candidate to undertake research 
in chosen area.  Number of courses can vary from 0 to 6. 
 
8.03 
 
 
 
 
 
8.04 
 
Qualifying Examination 
 
Before undertaking registration in Thesis, every student must pass the Ph.D. 
Qualifying Examination within the prescribed time, namely, two semesters 
(excluding summer term) after admission for students who are not required to take 
any course work out of the first kind of course-work and two semesters (excluding 
summer term) after clearance of courses prescribed by DRC. However, DCC is 
authorised to examine the needs of candidates on case by case basis and give 
additional time wherever needed. 
8.05 
 
46 
 
 
 
(a) 
As soon as a student has cleared the courses prescribed by the DRC 
covered in the first kind of course work, he/she should make a formal 
application to DRC for permission to appear for the Qualifying 
Examination. 
 8.06 
(b) 
For each student, qualifying examination will be conducted in two areas 
from the list of qualifying examination areas approved for the 
department. One of these must be in the area in which he/she proposes to 
undertake research. The list will be available with Dean AGSR which can 
be modified by the joint recommendation of DRCs of the campuses.  
With the increasing emphasis on multi-disciplinary research, PhD student 
can also choose one relevant area from departments other than his/her 
own department in consultation with notional supervisor. 
 
The candidate selected under (e) , (f) or (g) of clause 8.02 will also follow the 
same pattern of qualifying examinationas mentioned in clause 8.06 
 
8.07 
A student who has passed the Qualifying Examination will be formally 
admitted to the Ph.D. programme. His/her registration in the Thesis course can be 
allowed only after the Research Proposal is approved and fulfilment of the  of clause 
8.13. 
8.08 
If a student fails in the Qualifying Examination or fails to appear in the same 
in the first time, he/she may, at the discretion of DRC, be allowed to appear at this 
examination only once more, provided he/she does so within  the time limit 
prescribed in clause. It shall be the responsibility of such a student, to approach DRC 
immediately, for permission to take the Qualifying Examination once more. If this 
permission is denied, the student will be considered to have come under clause 8.38. 
8.09 
The Qualifying Examination will test the student's knowledge, grasp of 
fundamentals and his/her ability to use them in unknown situations. The Qualifying 
Examination will normally consist of written and oral tests. The oral test will follow 
the written papers and will attempt to probe the student further with reference to 
his/her answers in written papers and to test his/her presentation of ideas and 
concepts. 
8.10 
The Qualifying Examination will be conducted by respective DRC in every 
campus. 
8.11 
Language Requirement 
 
Every Ph.D. student is normally expected to demonstrate an ability to translate 
a piece from current periodicals in the area of major interest of the student in one of 
the modern European languages into English with the help of a dictionary. The 
modern European language will be named by Dean AGSR and may vary from 
student to student depending on his/her intended area of research. It will be in the 
interest of the student to complete the language requirement as soon as possible. 
However, the  Dean AGSR may waive the language requirement for a student if the 
Supervisor and DCC recommend that English is adequate for the intended research 
work. 
8.12 
 
47 
The language requirement, if not waived (see clause 8.12), can be fulfilled by 
any one of the following alternatives: 
8.13 
(i) 
If the student, before entering into the Ph.D. programme, has already done the 
prescribed foreign language course(s) of the Institute or its equivalent elsewhere 
and has obtained the minimum grade as prescribed by Dean AGSR, he/she 
would be pronounced to have fulfilled the language requirement of the Ph.D. 
programme.  
 
(ii) Where a student has no previous exposure to the prescribed language,  he/she 
will take the prescribed Institute course(s) on audit and obtain `satisfactory' 
grade(s) in such course(s). 
 
(iii) Where a student has learnt the prescribed language through self-study and 
claims that he is equipped to fulfill the language requirement, he/she should sit 
in a specially designed test to demonstrate the above mentioned ability. If  he/she 
fails to pass the test,  he/she may try again or take the special courses offered in 
the Institute as per the decision of  Dean AGSR. 
 
Whenever a student plans to work for a Ph.D. in any Indian 
language/literature, Dean AGSR may decide to exempt him/her from the above 
European language and require him/her to show his/her ability in an Indian language 
other than the language in which he/she proposes to pursue his/her Ph.D. research. In 
this case,  Dean AGSR will be guided in his/her decision by the spirit of clauses 8.12 
and 8.13. 
8.14 
Teaching Practice/Practice Lecture Series 
8.15 
Teaching Practice I or when it cannot be arranged, its alternative Practice 
Lecture Series I should be completed. These courses are normally registered 
immediately after admission or after completion of prescribed coursework. These 
courses attempt to train a Ph.D. student in the art, methodology and skill of teaching, 
communication, etc. 
 
Research Methodology:  
Research Methodology I course should be done in the semester/term 
following the semester of completing Teaching Practice I/ Practice Lecture Series I. 
This course is designed to impart training in analysis of research problem, 
mathematical and statistical analysis of data, experimental techniques etc. Students 
who have done this course in their higher degree or students who have done Teaching 
practice II/Practice lecture series II will be exempted from doing this course. 
Seminar/Independent Study 
 
(a) 
Clauses 6.15 & 6.19 on concurrent registration in Seminar (whenever Thesis 
is registered for) and registration in Independent Study as an alternative to 
Seminar, when the same cannot be arranged, also apply to the Ph.D. 
programme. 
8.16 
(b) 
In addition, a Ph.D. student is required to register in Seminar/Independent 
Study, starting from his/her first registration in the programme. Further, the 
total number of units assigned to these courses can be taken only one unit at 
a time in a semester/term until the units are exhausted, after which the student 
will register for one unit every semester. However, while he/she is doing one 
 
 
48 
 
 
or more courses of the First kind, he/she may not be required to register in 
Seminar/Independent Study unless specifically directed to do so by Dean 
AGSR. 
Topic of Research and Supervisor: 
Once a Ph D student clears the required qualifying examination, he/she, in 
consultation with his/her notional supervisor will decide upon the topic, the 
supervisor, co-supervisor (if required), prepare a research proposal and present it in 
writing and orally before the DAC members. For PhD students admitted under "part-
time" or under PhD aspirant scheme, it is mandatory to choose BITS faculty as 
supervisor. 
8.17 
The DRC will carefully evaluate whether the proposed topic of research is in 
consonance with the Institute's research goals, the facilities existing in the Institute or 
in the permitted locale for carrying out the work, the suitability of the proposed 
supervisor for the particular topic of research, the number of students already working 
under him/her and other relevant factors; and will forward the proposal to Dean 
AGSR. 
Dean, AGSR in consultation with Doctoral Counseling Committee members 
will approve the research proposal. 
8.18 
A student can take up research only on a topic and under a supervisor at a 
locale approved by the Dean, AGSR. Any change in the topic of 
research/supervisor/co-supervisor or locale of work can be made only with the prior 
approval of the  Dean, AGSR. 
8.19 
It shall be the responsibility of such a Ph.D. student to approach the Dean, 
AGSR through respective DRC well in time for a fresh decision on the question of 
supervisorship, if there is a likelihood of his/her ceasing to be a faculty member of 
the Institute or ceasing to be associated with a professional organisation. If no 
decision of the Dean, AGSR is available on the matter, his/her current semester/term 
registration in Thesis will be cancelled as soon as he ceases to be a faculty member 
or a professional and he will not be allowed to register subsequently unless the  Dean, 
AGSR decides on the matter. 
8.20 
Thesis 
 
The student will register for Thesis only after the topic of research and 
supervisor have been approved by the  Dean AGSR. 
8.21 
The total units assigned to this course in the Bulletin will be distributed over 
several semesters/terms as determined by  Dean AGSR. After the student completes 
the unit requirements of Thesis, he will be required to register every semester 
thereafter for 10 units till the submission of Thesis. 
8.22 
The title of the thesis will be recommended for approval by the DCC which 
will subsequently be approved by Dean AGSR. Any change in the title of the thesis 
can be made only with the prior approval of the  Dean AGSR. 
8.23 
The thesis should be written in English; provided that a thesis for a Ph.D. 
degree in any Indian language may be written in that language or in English. 
8.24 
 
49 
Submission of thesis 
 
(a) 
On completion of research, the student will prepare a draft of the thesis and 
its synopsis for preliminary but detailed evaluation by two members of DAC 
followed by oral presentation. A student must submit his/her final thesis to 
Chairman, DRC within ten semesters (excluding summer terms) to be 
counted from the semester following the semester of passing the Qualifying 
Examination. Whenever a student fails to submit his/her thesis within this 
stipulated time, he will come under clause 8.38. 
The duration for submitting final PhD thesis (including all extensions and 
semester withdrawals) is limited to 14 semesters to be counted from the 
semester following the passing of PhD qualifying examination. If a 
candidate fails to submit his/her final thesis during this period, he/she will 
be discontinued from the programme. The female candidates who have 
availed maternity leave during this period may be given one extra semester 
for thesis submission. 
In exceptional cases where the progress of PhD thesis has been affected by 
circumstances beyond control of the student like extreme medical condition 
or trauma, being on National duty (if the candidate is from the armed forces) 
etc. the duration of thesis submission can be extended to beyond 14 
semesters, as a onetime exception for specific semester(s) with the approval 
of the Vice-Chancellor whose decision in this regard shall be final. 
(b) 
The submission of the thesis for the purpose of the above clause will be 
considered to be in order only when approved by DRC and it has been done 
in accordance with the clause 8.26 below; otherwise the thesis would be 
returned to the student for removal of the inadequacy. 
8.25 
The submission of the thesis will 
8.26 
(a) 
require fulfillment of the following prior conditions: 
(i) 
the semester/term in which the thesis is being submitted is such that the 
immediately preceding interim grade in the Thesis course is 
'satisfactory'; 
(ii) 
the student as of that date, has fulfilled all the requirements of graduation 
in clause 9.02 except for para (vii), and 
(iii) the student has given reasonable evidence to  Dean, AGSR that at the 
time of/ during submission of the thesis no NC report would emerge 
causing embarrassment and dislocation of further processing of the 
thesis; and  
 
(b) 
entail simultaneous forwarding of the following to the DRC: 
(i) 
two printed bound copies and one soft copy of the thesis with a title 
consistent with the requirements of clause  
(ii) 
the thesis must contain a certificate from the supervisor and co-
supervisor (if any) to the effect that the thesis embodies original work 
done by the student under his/her supervision.  
(iii) soft copy of synopsis of the thesis as prescribed by Dean, AGSR to 
facilitate appointment of examiners; and 
 
 
50 
(iv) the receipt for payment of the requisite fees. 
(c) DRC will forward following documents to Dean, AGSR 
(i) Thesis  
(ii) Synopsis 
(iii) Reports of the DAC members on draft thesis 
(iv) The receipt for payment of the requisite fees. 
(v) The list of 6-8 potential thesis examiners based on a list of examiners 
submitted by supervisor(s) 
In exceptional circumstances, where a student, who is registered in the last 
components of the units assigned to Thesis/Seminar and may be also pursuing 
courses or completing other components of the requirements of the Ph.D. degree 
simultaneously in a semester, wishes to submit his/her thesis before the end of the 
semester, he  must  supply  strong evidence  to  Dean, AGSR  that all his/her current 
pursuits would co-terminate in such a way that conditions prescribed in the above 
clause would be fulfilled. If  Dean, AGSR accepts the thesis for further processing, 
he does so with the stipulation that he will stop this processing at any stage and even 
cause withholding of the final Thesis grade until all conditions stipulated in clause 
8.17 have been fulfilled. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.27 
Examination of thesis 
 
The thesis will be examined by two examiners appointed by the Vice-
Chancellor.  
8.28 
The examiners will give separate reports, each report concluding with a final 
and unequivocal verdict on the thesis in terms of only one of the following five 
alternatives: 
8.29 
(i) 
The thesis is approved for viva-voce examination, as is or minor 
corrections suggested, if any, to be addressed adequately by the student 
and approved by the supervisor(s), or 
 
(ii) Thesis is approved for viva-voce examination; major corrections 
suggested, to be addressed adequately by the student in consultation with 
supervisor(s) and certified by the Doctoral Advisory Committee, or 
 
(iii) Thesis is approved for viva-voce examination; major corrections 
suggested, to be addressed adequately by the student in consultation with 
supervisor(s) and certified by the examiner(s), or 
 
(iv) The thesis requires revision and resubmission, or 
 
(v) The thesis is rejected. 
 
a. If one examiner approves the thesis for viva-voce (verdict i, ii or iii) while 
the other examiner recommends revision and resubmission (verdict iv), the respective 
campus Associate Dean, AGSRD will make arrangements to share the two reports 
with the examiners and the supervisor/co-supervisor(s), and if necessary, convene a 
meeting among them to arrive at a unanimous verdict.  
When this process yields no unanimity, then the thesis will be sent for 
evaluation to a third examiner, appointed by the Vice-Chancellor and the verdict of 
8.30 
 
51 
this examiner will be final and binding. 
b. If both examiners recommend revision and resubmission (verdict 4), the 
student will be required to revise and resubmit his/her thesis for re-examination by 
the same examiners as far as possible. 
c. If one examiner approves the thesis or recommends revision and 
resubmission (verdict i, ii, iii or iv) while the other examiner rejects the thesis (verdict 
v), the respective campus Associate Dean, AGSRD will make arrangements to share 
the two reports with the examiners and the supervisor/co-supervisor(s), and if 
necessary, convene a meeting among them to arrive at a unanimous verdict. When 
this process yields no unanimity, then the thesis will be sent for evaluation to a third 
examiner, appointed by the Vice-Chancellor and the verdict of this examiner will be 
final and binding. 
d. If both examiners recommend rejection of the thesis (verdict v), the thesis 
stands rejected. When the thesis is rejected, the student's registration in the Thesis 
course for that semester will be cancelled and he will be asked to discontinue from 
the programme and his/her grade sheet will show DP against the Thesis course. 
When a thesis has been unanimously approved by the external examiners, a 
viva-voce of the thesis will be conducted by one of the external examiners at the 
respective campus in presence of the supervisor and co-supervisor(s). However, in 
extra ordinary situations such as a pandemic the viva-voce can be conducted online 
using technology. The Vice Chancellor is authorized to reconstitute this team when 
deemed necessary. At the end of the viva-voce, the external examiner in consultation 
with the Supervisor / Co-Supervisor(s) will award the final Grade. 
When a student has been required to revise and resubmit his/her thesis, his/her 
status will revert to what it was, in all respects, before he submitted his/her thesis but 
would not alter the original deadline for submission of the thesis. If the current last 
date of submission of the thesis is considered to be inadequate he/she must 
immediately request for extra time from the Doctoral Counseling Committee. The 
revised thesis should be examined as far as possible by the same team of examiners. 
8.31 
When a thesis has been approved unanimously by the examiners, a viva-voce 
on the thesis will be conducted at respective campus in presence of  the (i) Supervisor 
(ii)at least one external examiner, and (iii) Co-supervisor(s), if any. The Vice-
Chancellor is authorised to reconstitute the team of examiners for viva-voce 
whenever deemed necessary. At the end of the viva-voce examination the team of 
examiners collectively will award the final grade as per clause4.11, on the Thesis 
course. In awarding this final grade the examiners will combine the assessment of the 
thesis with the performance of the student in the viva-voce examination. All his/her 
records pertaining to the interim Thesis grades would be made available to the team 
of examiners. 
8.32 
In the case of a Ph.D. student, whose viva-voce examination is held during 
the same semester in which he submitted the thesis, his/her performance in the 
viva-voce will also be judged for awarding the final grade in the 
Seminar/Independent Study course and the result for viva-voce will produce the 
grade for thesis as well as for Seminar/Independent Study. The eligibility will be 
worked out as soon as the viva-voce result is available without waiting till the end of 
the semester. 
 
 
52 
However, if at the time of/ during submission of the thesis any NC report 
emerges the viva-voce will be postponed until this affliction is removed as per the 
regulations. If however, the viva-voce has been already held the final Thesis grade 
will be withheld. 
8.33 
The viva-voce examination on the Ph.D. thesis will be open to research 
students, faculty members, staff members charged with similar professional duties 
and any other person permitted by Dean, AGSR, all as silent observers. 
8.34 
Minimum academic requirements for continuation: 
8.35 
A student will not be permitted to continue in the Institute under any one of the 
following situations: 
 
(i) 
he fails to take or pass the Qualifying Examination within the prescribed time 
(see 8.04 & 8.06); 
 
(ii) 
his/her CGPA, where applicable, falls below 5.50 and he fails to bring it up to 
5.50 within two subsequent semesters  and his/her CGPA falls below 5.50 and 
he/she fails to bring it up to 5.50 within two subsequent semesters (see 8.03); 
 
(iii) He/she accumulates two consecutive interim 'unsatisfactory' grades in the 
Thesis course; 
 
(iv) 
He/she fails to submit his/her thesis/revised thesis within the time prescribed 
for him/her, for such submission; 
 
(v) 
his/her thesis is rejected by the examiners; 
 
(vi) 
his/her thesis does not receive unanimous final verdict from the examiners 
as required in clauses  
 
(vii)    He/she receives final grade as ‘unacceptable’ in Thesis. 
 
(a)   Of the above seven stipulations the first four, viz, specify the intermediate 
steps necessitating monitoring for a student before submission of his/her 
thesis. This monitoring is to be done by the DRC  
8.36 
(b)  The last three stipulations, viz. specify the events after the submission of 
the thesis and its examination by the appointed examiners. In such cases 
a student will be discontinued from the programme. However, he may 
appeal to the Dean, AGSR for reinstatement giving full exposition and 
justification for the appeal. If the Dean AGSR decides to reinstate such 
a student it will give clear instructions and conditions, consistent with 
overall spirit of these regulations that the student must fulfil after 
reinstatement. The verdict of the Dean, AGSR shall be final. 
 
Doctoral Counselling Committee 
In all matters where the student has to approach the DCC, applications must 
invariably be submitted through DRC, who will assist the DCC with supporting 
documents and their recommendations consistent with these Regulations, Institute’s 
research goals, facilities available and other pertinent factors. 
 
 
8.37 
Registration and Monitoring 
 
Registration of a PhD student will be done separately by registration cell of 
each campus on recommendation of Associate Dean, AGSR, who will keep the Dean, 
8.38 
 
53 
AGSR informed. Whenever the lack of progress of a student forewarns the 
application of Clause or when a student defaults under Clause the student will be 
guided for his/her registration by the DCC. The DCC will function like the ACB for 
monitoring the progress of the student. The DCC can give additional time/attempt to 
pass the qualifying examination; it can prescribe additional course(s) or require the 
student to repeat course(s) already cleared; it can require the student to drop some 
semester(s), it can give extension of time for the submission of the thesis. In short, it 
will take appropriate action to help the student to meet the minimum academic 
requirements stipulated in Clause as early as possible. The DCC has also the authority 
to conclude whether a student should be continued as a Ph.D. student or not. The 
DCC will report its decision to the Senate.  
Human Resource Development 
 
With a view to accelerating human resource development, the Dean, AGSR 
on the recommendation of the DRC concerned may permit, when possible, a faculty 
member of the Institute or a staff member charged with similar professional duties to 
appear in the Ph.D. qualifying examination even though he/she is not registered under 
the Ph.D. programme. Similarly, the Dean, AGSR on the recommendations of the 
DRC, may permit professionals (under Ph.D. aspirants scheme) to appear in the Ph.D. 
qualifying examination even before he is registered for Ph.D. 
8.39 
If a candidate mentioned in clause 8.39 passes this examination, he/she has to 
seek formal admission to the Ph.D. programme to pursue the same as per these 
regulations. If he/she, however, fails to appear in or pass the examination, he/she can 
avail of another chance also subject to necessary permission from the Dean, AGSR. 
However, if he/she fails to appear in the examination on genuine grounds, Dean, 
AGSR  may condone such an absence, on a case by case basis. 
8.40 
Research at Outside Centres 
 
(a) 
The Vice-Chancellor may entertain a proposal not covered under clause 6.21 
from a student/professional seeking permission to carry out a part or whole of 
his/her Ph.D. research at a suitable centre outside the Institute, if he is satisfied 
that the proposal is consistent with the overall educational and research goals 
of the Institute.  
8.41 
(b) 
If the permission is granted, the student will be registered for the 
Thesis-Seminar/Independent Study only. 
8.42 
These regulations permit, through the scheme of linkage with sister 
universities or research organisations, the possibility of pursuit of a prescribed portion 
of Ph.D. work of a student of the Institute in another organisation, as well as of a 
Ph.D. student of another university pursuing his/her programme at the Institute. The 
Vice-Chancellor is authorized to implement the above within the general framework 
of these regulations and report the same to the Senate. 
 
Transfer from/to a First/Higher Degree 
 
(a) 
A student of good standing in any of the integrated first degree/higher degrees 
may be permitted, as a special case, by Dean, AUGS/AGSR to appear in the 
Ph.D. Qualifying Examination, provided the requirements of Clause regarding 
course package prescribed by DRC have been completed. 
8.43 
 
54 
(b) 
A Higher Degree student may be permitted to transfer to Ph.D. degree. Such a 
student may also be awarded the higher degree on successful completion of 
requirements of the same, while continuing to be a Ph.D. student. 
 
(c) 
A bright and promising Integrated First Degree student may be transferred to 
a Higher Degree/Ph.D. degree. Such a student will be automatically awarded 
the intermediate First Degree(s) and Higher Degree in a concurrent way as 
soon as all the requirements of the Degree(s) are completed. However, if a 
student wants his/her intermediate First Degree/Higher Degree(s) at an earlier 
time, he/she must opt for it within the semester after he/she completes the 
requirements of First Degree/Higher Degree(s). 
In case the CGPA of the transferred student falls below 5.50, he will 
come under the purview of ACB, which will automatically transfer him/her 
back to his/her Integrated First degree(s). Further, if a student does not 
complete the requirements of Ph.D. degree, he may be transferred back at any 
stage. 
 
On passing Ph.D. Qualifying Examination under 8.05, the student may, with the 
approval of Dean, AGSR, choose one of the following options to get formally 
admitted to Ph.D. programme. 
8.44 
(i) 
He/she completes his/her present degree and joins the Ph.D. programme on a 
date agreed to by the Institute. 
 
(ii) 
He/she immediately becomes a Ph.D. student skipping his/her present degree 
(telescoping). His/her current registration in the First Degree/Higher Degree 
courses would be revised by cancelling registration in courses which are no 
longer needed for his/her Ph.D. programme and adding courses which he/she 
can use for his/her Ph.D. programme. The normal rule of transfer will operate 
with the further condition that the total requirement in terms of courses and 
other components for such a student would not be more than what it would 
have been if he/she was directly admitted to the Ph.D. programme. As far as 
possible, this formal transfer to the Ph.D. programme should take place in the 
beginning of a semester. If, however, Dean, AGSR, in consultation with 
DRC, is satisfied that sticking to the schedule will result in loss of time for 
the student, he may permit such revision of registration even later than the 
beginning of the semester. 
 
If such a student does not appear in or pass the Ph.D. qualifying examination he/she 
will be treated in the way described in clause  
8.45 
(a) A Ph.D. student may seek from Dean, AGSR a transfer to a Higher Degree 
programme, subject to the general stipulation that he/she does not already 
possess the same degree or its equivalent. If such a permission is given to 
the student,  he/she carries forward his/her up-to-date scholastic standing 
in terms of courses, units, grades, CGPA and any sanctions, to this new 
programme. 
8.46 
(b) Subject to the stipulation in clause above, it is possible for a Ph.D. student 
who has been required to discontinue under clause 8.35, to seek a transfer 
to one of the Higher Degrees of the Institute. 
 
 
55 
(c) In both the above cases the transfer can be sought only in the beginning 
of a semester and only to that Higher Degree which has been notionally 
identified for him/her. The usual rules of transfer will apply. If this 
permission is granted, the completed units for various courses and 
research work wherever feasible may be credited for higher degree 
subject to case by case examination. 
The course work requirements of a higher degree may overlap with those of the 
Ph.D. degree. When a Ph.D. student is doing higher degree courses, he may also 
be permitted to register for additional requirements of the higher degree and may 
be considered to be simultaneously a student of the higher degree as well as the 
Ph.D. degree. He will be awarded the higher degree as soon as he completes the 
requirements for the same and continue to be a Ph.D. student. 
8.47 
 
9. Graduation and Eligibility for all Degrees 
 
A student is deemed to have fulfilled the requirement of graduation for an 
integrated first degree (single or dual degree) or a higher degree when He/she has: 
9.01 
(i) cleared all courses prescribed for in his/her programme or his/her 
composite programme, as the case may be; 
 
(ii) cleared the total unit requirements of Thesis, Seminar and Dissertation 
wherever  applicable; 
 
(iii) obtained a minimum CGPA of 4.50 in case of First Level 
Diploma/B.Sc./Integrated First Degree programmes; and CGPA of 5.50 in 
case of Higher Level Diploma/Higher Degree programmes unless stated 
otherwise for a particular programmes. 
 
(iv) remained outside the purview of ACB or been declared to be outside its 
purview; 
 
(v) overcome all consequential stipulations (see 4.20) of an NC report; except 
where there if an NC report in an elective course over and above the 
prescribed number of elective courses or in a course  which has ceased to 
be a part of his/her current programme as a result of the latest transfer 
operations; and 
 
(vi) satisfied all requirements of these regulations. 
A first degree student admitted to a minor program is eligible to receive a minor 
certificate if he/she has completed the degree requirements stated above and has: 
(i) completed the core courses required for the minor and the stipulated 
number of electives from the pool for that minor 
(ii) obtained a minimum CGPA of 4.50 in the courses applied to the minor. 
 
9.01a 
A student is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of graduation for a Ph.D. 
degree when He/she has: 
9.02 
(i) 
passed the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination; 
 
(ii) fulfilled the language requirement; 
 
(iii) fulfilled Teaching Practice/ Practice Lecture Series / Research 
Methodology requirement; 
 
 
56 
 
10. Additional Regulations for off-campus, Work Integrated 
Learning and Collaborative Programmes 
 
While the Regulations described in earlier sections apply uniformly to all on-
campus and off-campus programmes of the Institute, some additional regulations 
specifically applicable to the off-campus programmes are stated in this Section. 
10.01 
The on-campus and off-campus, Work Integrated Learning and Collaborative 
programmes are defined in section 1.00. 
10.02 
While every on-campus degree programme can be theoretically offered as an 
off-campus programme through the “Work Integrated Learning Programmes 
Division” the Institute will decide from time to time, depending upon feasibility and 
capability of maintaining corresponding standard, which on-campus degree can be 
operated as off-campus programmes. However, certain off-campus degree 
programmes, may not be offered as on-campus degree programmes. Since the 
10.03 
(iv) cleared the total unit requirements, (including additional requirements, 
if any) prescribed for Thesis and Seminar/Independent Study (see 
8.22& 8.16); 
 
(v) cleared all prescribed course-work; 
 
(vi) obtained, where applicable, a minimum CGPA of 5.50 in coursework; 
 
(vii) obtained a final grade in Thesis as ‘acceptable’; 
 
(viii) overcome all consequential stipulations (see 4.20) of an NC report; and 
 
(ix) satisfied all requirements of these regulations and those prescribed by 
Dean, AGSR. 
 
A student is deemed to have become eligible for the degree if, in addition to 
satisfying the requirements of clause 9.01 or 9.02 as the case may be, He/she has : 
9.03 
(i) 
satisfied all rules of evaluation; 
(ii) no case of indiscipline or unfair means is pending against him/her. 
 
However, in case of a student having outstanding dues against him/her to be paid 
to the Institute, Hostel or any other recognised organ of the Institute, his/her degree 
will be withheld until the said dues are cleared. 
 
(a) The following classification based on CGPA will be made for integrated 
first degree programmes: 
Distinction - CGPA 9.00 or more 
I Division 
- CGPA 7.00 or more but less than 9.00 
II Division - CGPA 4.50 or more but less than 7.00 
Since the B.Sc. degree (for working professionals) also falls under a First 
Degree programme of the institute, the criteria prescribed for the award of Division 
for a B.Sc. degree  shall be the same as that of other First Degree programmes as 
specified under 9.04(a) above. 
9.04 
(b) No division will be awarded in diploma, higher degrees and Ph.D. 
programmes.  
 
 
57 
admission criteria and the operational details may vary between on-campus and off-
campus programmes, transfer from on-campus to off-campus and vice versa, even 
for the same discipline/branch, will not be automatic. 
Whenever   in a special situation the movement is permitted between on campus 
and off-campus degree programmes, the same will not be conceived as a transfer, but 
will be visualized as a notional readmission with the following criteria: “In the case 
of a student permitted to move from off-campus to on-campus programmes, the 
student should go through the competitive methodology employed for admission to 
on-campus programmes and also satisfy other essential requirements. The students 
who are permitted to move from on-campus to off-campus programmes have to 
satisfy the conditions of the work environment in terms of facilities, mentor, etc. As 
in the case of readmission, the academic credits will be carried over. Further 
whenever such transfers take place, the degree awarded to a student will be the degree 
in which He/she is registered during the last semester of his/her graduation”. 
10.04 
Since the off-campus the programmes invariably require suitable learning 
environment for the students admitted to these programmes, the Institute will ensure 
the viability of the physical facilities, availability of other manpower (who could act 
as mentor/tutor for the students), motivation of students etc. before undertaking to 
run any such programme. The off-campus programmes will normally be run for 
students sponsored by their employers after ensuring the feasibility of converting 
their work environment into a learning environment. The Institute may also decide 
to run off-campus programmes as a manpower development programmes for the 
employed professionals. An employed person admitted to any off-campus 
programme will be treated as a full-time student and a full-time employee 
simultaneously. However, there are some emerging areas where new manpower may 
be required necessitating training of fresh students with the help of collaborating 
organizations towards well defined professional goals. In such cases, the Institute can 
also admit students who may not be already employed. However, all such students 
would have access to all the infrastructural facilities and other resources of the 
collaborating organization where the programme is conducted. 
10.05 
All the off-campus programmes will be conducted by the Work Integrated 
Learning Programmes Division and its Dean will be the deciding authority in the 
operation of all the necessary activities for the conduct of these programmes, 
specifically, He/she will be the ex-officio instructor-in-charge for all courses offered 
for the off-campus programmes and will be in-charge of registration, evaluation and 
monitoring of the programmes.  Wherever necessary, He/she will consult Dean, 
AUGS/AGSR and Dean PS. The off- campus programmes will be conducted by a 
team of instructors drawn from the Institute faculty with the active help and 
participation of mentor/tutor from the host organisation or other organisations in the 
same locale. The tutor/mentor will guide the students in self-study and serve as a link 
between the instructor and student on all academic and other related matters. Every 
student while applying for admission to an off-campus programme has to submit 
consent of the organisation sponsoring him and also submit a detailed biodata and 
consent of the tutor/mentor. Every tutor/mentor have to be approved by the Dean and 
will be deemed to be a “teacher” of the Institute for the purpose of academic 
regulation. 
10.06 
 
 
 
58 
Whenever the work environment of a student in any Work Integrated 
Learning/Collaborative Programme ceases to be viable or when his/her sponsorship 
is withdrawn by his/her employer, the student may be discontinued from the 
programme and the Institute will have no further obligation in this matter. Similarly, 
whenever an organisation, which agreed to collaborate with the Institute for running 
a degree programme for a targetted population of the organisation, discontinues the 
facilities necessary for the conduct of the programme, the Institute may cancel such 
a programme without affording opportunity to these students registered therein to 
complete their degrees. In such cases also, the Institute will have no further obligation 
in this matter. 
10.07 
Students of the off-campus programmes may be permitted to take underload or 
have gaps between semesters/terms. In such cases, pace of progress would be suitably 
computed ignoring such gap(s) and clause 5.02(iii) will be applied accordingly. 
10.08 
For a targeted population with an aggregate level of background identified to be 
of a higher level than the normal input level, certain truncated programmes consisting 
of courses to be done by such candidates may be formulated. In working out such 
truncated programmes, which will be deemed to be equivalent to full programmes 
for the purpose of award of a degree, the AGC may, however, be not guided by a 
course by course exemption out of a notional full programme as in the case of 
students admitted on an advanced standing basis. 
10.09 
In addition to the general conditions specified in Section 7 of the Regulations for 
operation of the flexibilities like transfer, dual degree, admissions with advanced 
standing/marginal deficiency, etc., the following guidelines will be followed. 
10.10 
(a) Transfer:Transfers from one off-campus programme to another may be 
permitted after a thorough examination of such a request on a case by case 
basis by AGC (see also clause 10.04). 
 
(b) Dual Degree: Conceptually dual degrees in the off-campus programmes 
will not be valid because of their being target population oriented. Even 
then, on rare occasions, requests for dual degrees may be entertained 
provided in the corresponding alter-ego programmes in on-campus system 
such dual degree combinations are permitted. Hence, each request for dual 
degree will be examined on a case by case basis by the AGC. 
 
(c) Admissions with Advanced Standing/Marginal Deficiency: There may 
be cases for whom admissions may be considered on the basis of advanced 
standing/marginal deficiency principle even in cases of students admitted 
to truncated programmes. 
 
The work integrated learning and collaborative programmes may have a 
semester wise course structure with a view to sequencing of the courses. However, 
such structures would not have the rigidity on-campus programmes' semester wise 
course structures and as such prior preparation, backlog in registration, etc. will not 
be very meaningful for the off-campus programmes. The courses like Work 
Experience, Practice School, Thesis-Seminar, Internship, Dissertation, Project Work, 
Capstone Project etc., have to be taken normally after completing all other course 
work. Work Experience, Internship, Dissertation, Project Work, Capstone Project, 
Project and Practice School courses are not interchangeable even if such courses are 
10.11 
 
59 
offered in the same locale. 
The Institute may enter into collaborative arrangements with industries, R&D 
labs., universities etc. and may introduce suitable degree programmes in all tiers of 
education to match the needs of human resource development in host organisations. 
The Institute may also introduce diploma programmes at the first level as well as the 
higher level. The Institute may also permit in specific first degree programmes 
multiple exit points leading to first level diploma or senior first level diploma in the 
same discipline. 
10.12 
A higher level diploma may be part of a higher degree programme. Some 
students admitted to the higher degree programme may be notionally considered 
as the students of the diploma programme, upon completion of which they may be 
permitted to continue for the higher degree. 
10.13 
Since the degree/diploma programmes are designed to suit the manpower 
development needs and are based on student inputs with diverse qualifications/ 
and/or experiences, the unit requirements of such programmes will be spelt out when 
the same are introduced if they differ from the existing programmes. The matter will 
be reported to the Senate. 
10.14 
The eligibility for the award of First Level, Senior First Level and Higher Level 
diplomas will be worked out as per clauses 9.01 and 9.03. 
10.15 
Certain contingencies may arise when the academic calendar of a Work 
Integrated Learning and Collaborative Programme differs from the normal 
academic calendar of the Institute. Whenever such a contingency arises, the 
academic calendar of that programme will be worked out by the Dean, WILP in 
consultation with the clause 1.08 Committee. If such a reworked calendar routinely 
differs from the normal calendar, it may be termed as labile semester/term, if so 
required for operational purposes. 
10.16 
Under very special circumstances, a student may be permitted to register in on-
campus as well as off-campus courses during any semester/term. Such registration as 
well as the necessary credit transfer will be permitted by Clause 1.08 Committee in 
the case of Integrated First Degree programmes and by the Higher Degree 
Counselling Committee in the case of Higher Degree programmes, on a case by case 
basis. 
10.17 
Since all off-campus degree programmes are heavily committed and are 
operated in collaboration and association with named organisations, students 
admitted to any such programme are also subject to the general discipline and code 
of conduct applicable to the employees of these organisations. Failure of a student to 
conform with the same may result in his/her being required to discontinue from 
his/her programme. 
10.18 
Some off-campus degree programmes may have students without any affiliation 
to a particular organisation and some may have students not affiliated to a 
collaborating organisation but to certain like-minded organisations. However, for all 
such students, consent of the collaborating organisations would be necessary. 
10.19 
In all off-campus programmes the pedagogy will emphasise self-study and 
discussions along with traditional methods of instruction. 
10.20 
Since the off-campus programmes heavily depend on the facilities and the 
10.21 
 
60 
environment provided by the collaborating organizations, some unforeseen 
exigencies may arise necessitating termination of a programme in the midstream. In 
such exigencies the Institute may take possible steps to salvage the situation, if the 
concerned students fully cooperate in such measures. 
The location and pursuit of courses like dissertation, Project Work, Project, 
Capstone Project, internship, work experience etc., of the off-campus programmes 
need not necessarily coincide with the town and organization where other courses for 
a same programme were conducted due to organisational needs or the nature of 
special courses. However, wherever such courses are conducted there must be a 
collaborating organisation to ensure the necessary facilities and environment. 
10.22 
Additional transcript, similar to the type of Practice School Transcript giving 
pedagogy and details of the programmes may also be issued to the students of off-
campus programmes by the Work Integrated Learning Programmes Division. 
10.23 
At the end of every semester/term the following minimum academic standards 
have to be achieved by the students in the various off-campus, Work Integrated 
Learning and Collaborative Programmes: 
10.24 
(i)    The student should not have secured any E grade. 
 
(ii) A student should have CGPA of at least 4.50 in the case of integrated first 
degree/first level diploma and at least 5.50 in the case of higher degree/higher 
level diploma. 
 
(iii) A student should have at least cleared as per his/her latest performance, such 
courses (counted from the point of his/her entry into the Institute) as are 
prescribed for a period that corresponds to two-thirds of the number of semesters 
spent by him/her since his/her entry into the Institute with reference to his/her 
current programme. This means that at any stage of reckoning the student should 
not have spent more than 50% extra time than what is prescribed for him/her 
upto that stage. 
 
Students who do not meet one or more of the requirements given in clause 10.24 
will come under the purview of Academic Monitoring Board consisting of the 
following members: Dean, Work Integrated Learning Programmes (Convenor), 
Associate Dean, Work Integrated Learning Programmes, Dean AUGS, Dean AGSR, 
Dean Practice School. 
10.25 
This Board will function the same way as the Academic Counselling Board and 
also will have all the authorities of the ACB mentioned in Section 5 of the Academic 
Regulations. 
 
Certain specialized programmes may require situation-specific/person-centered 
operational rules. This will be approved by the concerned authorities and shall be 
notified from time to time through Information Brochure(s) of Work Integrated 
Learning Programmes Division, Institute Bulletin, etc.

11. Linkages with earlier Regulations 
 
This Academic Regulation incorporates all the changes that have been approved 
by the Senate after the printing of the previous version of the Academic Regulations. 
11.01 
These regulations will apply to the continuing students in all programmes 
11.02 
 
61 
admitted under earlier regulations in addition to the transitory provisions applicable 
to them. 
12. Follow-Through Actions 
 
In a system of continuous evaluation where the various components of teaching 
and evaluation culminate at the end of each semester, it is but natural to view the 
registration process and all related activities as a continuous operation in search of 
finding out when a student meets the requirements of graduation. To pursue this task 
methodically and effectively, use is made of what is known as Eligibility Sheet, 
which is actually a reproduction of the semester wise pattern for each student with 
any additional components, if found necessary. Recalling that information on the 
registration card is tallied against the grade sheet, all information available up to the 
latest grade sheet is abstracted, entered and updated in the Eligibility Sheet semester 
after semester. In the performance of this task it would be useful to recall certain 
nomenclature which have been already defined in these regulations. 
 
Whenever a student has properly registered in a course, the outcome at the end 
of the semester will be a grade or a report (except for a course registered originally 
but subsequently substituted by another course at the time of amendment of the 
original registration). The above outcome is defined as a performance in a course. 
When the performance is a grade, the student is said to have cleared the course. When 
this grade does not fulfil the prerequisite requirement of a subsequent course, the 
grade would be termed `inadequate' or 'not adequate'. 
 
Now, these regulations provide for a student to repeat a course at his/her own 
option or for a designated authority to require a course to be registered again, even 
after this course has been cleared earlier with or without adequate grade. Visualizing 
that the student may make several attempts at the same course throughout his/her 
existence in the programme, the Eligibility Sheet will continuously record the grades 
and reports against each course in his/her programme through this multiple 
performance. 
 
Above entries made against a course produce a series of performances. It is, 
however, only the last performance which will guide action. A simplified procedure 
is to ignore all Ws and all innocuous RCs and look at the latest performance in the 
truncated series. If this latest performance in the truncated series is a grade, it 
becomes the operative grade for the purpose of CGPA, prerequisite, repetition of the 
course and all other matters of registration where the information about grade in a 
course is necessary. If the latest performance in the truncated series is a report, the 
nature of the report will control further action. 
 
For the operation of these regulations, the meaning of the word Electives can be 
understood only in the context in which it is being used. When it is used with 
reference to a classification of a course by a discipline or a category, it denotes the 
academic objective of that course in relation to other courses. When this term is used 
in the context of the structure, it refers to a category of courses which are not named 
in the Bulletin or by a designated authority. Thus, the elective courses in the context 
of structure are simply the courses which a student selects from a pool of available 
courses outside his/her own named courses. This pool, therefore, will contain, among 
others, courses which are academically definable as Core Course(s)and their 
 
 
62 
extensions known as Discipline Courses other than Compulsory (Discipline 
Elective). 
Structurally speaking, the specific discipline character of a programme is 
bestowed by the categories Core Course(s), which is compulsory and Discipline 
elective, which is optional. These courses simply cannot be placed in a general 
cafeteria for non-majors to pick and choose. Before placing these courses in the 
general pool, their integrity must be preserved by devising suitable protective 
restrictions around them. 
 
By the same token, the theme of flexibilities cannot be allowed to be overstated 
to such an extent that the academic selectivity, challenge and rigour are to be relaxed 
in any application of these flexibilities. 
 
The meaning and the application of some other expressions in these regulations 
will be clear only after a point of reckoning before a semester/term has been selected 
in respect of each student in the semester wise pattern of his/her prescribed 
programme. This point of reckoning depends on the efflux of time from the date of 
entry of the student into the Institute and identifies the current semester for the 
student. 
 
Prescribed Semester Courses (PSC) are those courses which appear in the 
student's current semester; while higher level courses are courses which appear in 
his/her subsequent semesters and Backlog (BL) courses appears in his/her previous 
semesters. 
 
The specific meaning and operation attached to the term BL aim to determine 
how the clearing of backlog can be simultaneously done along with forward 
movement in a controlled manner. Further, according to this postulate of BL in case 
like admission with advanced standing, admission with marginal deficiency, transfer, 
etc., a student may begin with a backlog even at the point of entry to his/her 
programme. 
 
On the other hand, the requirement of prior preparation is stated in terms of what 
courses a student must have cleared before He/she is allowed to register in certain 
intended course like PS, TS or a set of courses like Core Courses. The lack of this 
prior preparation, even by a single course, precludes registration in the above 
intended courses. 
 
The requirement of prerequisite is always described only in terms of a pair of 
courses where grade obtained in the first must be adequate before a student is 
permitted to register in the second. 
 
Having thus introduced these terms, it would be illuminating to compare and 
contrast the three expressions: backlog, prior preparation and prerequisite. In spite of 
the apparent similarity in the concept and purpose behind these three expressions, it 
should be clear that their definitions are unique, they are not interchangeable terms 
and their applications are for meeting distinctly different needs. While prior 
preparation and prerequisite are requirements without which forward movement is 
prohibited, backlog is an information on a list of courses which measures the burden 
of the past and perceives what supplementary efforts are needed to move forward. 
While backlog and prior preparation estimates scan all courses (in different sets) 
previous to the point of reckoning, prerequisite deals with a pair of courses on a one-
 
 
63 
to-one correspondence. Gradewise, prior preparation requires only the minimum 
grade, prerequisite requires a specific grade which may be more than the minimum 
and backlog is concerned with both minimum grades as well as adequate grades. To 
appreciate and apply these regulations meaningfully, it should be borne in mind that 
these three expressions have highly specific imports and applications. These are not 
to be used synonymously or interchangeably. 
Having described the format of the information base, three distinct parts of the 
follow-through actions will now be enumerated for a thumb nail reference for all 
concerned. 
 
(a) Registration time 
 
1. Clause 3.09 will inform whether the student can be registered at all in the 
semester. 
 
2. The correct courses of (BL) and (PSC) in which the student can be registered 
are to be identified as per clauses 3.25(a),3.21 & 10.11. 
 
3. 
(i)  The first charge in the registration card shall always be (BL) which 
reduces to (OBL). If the student remains content in registering in (OBL) or 
less He/she will not register in any other course in the semester. 
(ii) If the student wants to proceed beyond (OBL) his/her second charge must 
be (OPSC) or at least a portion of (OPSC). 
(iii) If He/she has only (OBL) plus a part of (OPSC), He/she cannot register 
in any other course in the semester. 
(iv) If the student registers in (OBL) plus (OPSC) only, then He/she can be 
permitted to register in higher level/repeat course. 
(v) Certain conflicts between (OBL) and (OPSC) in the full formulation can 
be resolved only by Dean, AUGS/AGSR (clauses 3.25 I, II, III & IV). 
 
4. 
Where a student has no (OBL), his/her first charge is (PSC) and the above 
formulation will begin with (PSC) rather than (BL). 
 
5. 
Courses belonging to a prerequisite chain should be fully scrutinized before 
registration is permitted. Similarly, conditions of over preparedness, under 
preparedness and banning of certain courses to specific group of students as 
specified in the Bulletin (see clauses 3.13, 3.15, 3.18 & Bulletin). 
 
6. 
Before permitting registration in courses like PS I, PS II, TS, Core Courses for 
single or dual degree, the required prior preparation enunciated in clause 3.14 
must be ensured. 
 
7. 
In the selection of courses under elective/the conditions imposed in clause 3.15 
must be fulfilled. 
 
8. 
Registration in electives in addition to the required number needs certain 
vigilance as described in clauses 2.08& 2.09. 
 
9. 
For courses to be taken only on audit, clause 7.33 to be consulted. 
 
10. It is to be noted that in the integrated first degree programmes and higher 
degree programmes, there is no scope for taking any other course along with 
PS or Thesis-Seminar or Internship I or Internship II.
