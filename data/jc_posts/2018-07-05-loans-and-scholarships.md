<p>With increasing costs of education everywhere, securing other sources<br />
 to fund your educational expenses is becoming a necessity. While the<br />
campus does provide you with ample opportunities in various fields, the<br />
tuition fees and other requirements do come off as a burden. Keeping<br />
this in mind, several scholarship programs were introduced by the<br />
institute. Also, educational loans are provided by most banks. Bank<br />
Loans, Merit-cum-need (MCN) Scholarship, Merit Scholarships, Inspire and<br />
 KVPY Scholarships are some of the ways you can avail financial support<br />
on campus.</p>

<h2>Bank Loans</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Most people on campus take loans from public sector/government banks,<br />
 and a majority of loans for on-campus students are probably handled by<br />
the SBI Bank that's on campus. <a href="https://www.sbi.co.in/portal/web/student-platform/scholar-loan">SBI Scholar Loan</a><br />
 is a pretty flexible loan policy which entitles the student to avail<br />
loan amounts up to 20 lakhs without collateral and up to 30 lakhs with<br />
tangible collateral. Also, you're allowed to pre-pay your loan at any<br />
given point.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The loan process can take quite a while after filling the documents<br />
as the bank will be flooded with loan applications at the beginning of<br />
the year. However, if you ensure that your loan gets sanctioned within<br />
the first semester itself, the first semester fee you've already paid<br />
can also be remitted to you by the bank.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Given below is a list of documents you'll probably need to apply for a loan.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Private banks like ICICI and HDFC also provide scholar and<br />
educational loans to students - it might be worth checking those out<br />
too.</p>

<h3>Vidya Lakshmi Portal</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Most banks, including the SBI, now ask people interested in loans to<br />
fill out the form online at the Vidya Lakshmi portal and then come to<br />
the bank with documents for verification.  As of now there 34 banks<br />
registered to this platform. Students can browse through various schemes<br />
 and decide which one to apply to. Not all the banks will provide loans<br />
for the complete fee that and some banks may provide till a maximum of<br />
10 lakhs as a loan.</p>

<h3>Merit Scholarship</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Top 1% of students</strong> -&gt; 80% waiver in fees<br />
<strong>Next Top 2% students</strong> -&gt; 40% waiver in fees</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The scholarships are given on the basis of CG (cumulative grade) of<br />
all semesters prior to that. The Merit scholarship is hard to achieve<br />
given the competition, and CG cutoffs for this are always 9.3+. If<br />
you're aiming for this, buckle up and try hard. You don't have to<br />
register or apply for the merit scholarship. If you're in the top 3%,<br />
you automatically get it.</p>

<h3>Merit Cum Need (MCN) Scholarship</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Merit-cum-Need Scholarship or MCN is just like the merit<br />
scholarship, but with a constraint: your annual family income should be<br />
below a threshold, which was 8lpa last year. To be eligible for this<br />
scholarship, you need to apply for it when the notice comes out. You'll<br />
have to submit proofs to show that your family income is beneath the<br />
threshold.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>KVPY and Inspire</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Both these Scholarships provide funding to students who have taken up<br />
 Bachelor's or Master's Degree in pure and basic sciences. So, only<br />
students of MSc Bio, Physics, Math and Chemistry are eligible for this.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>KVPY provides stipend up to 20,000 Rs a semester for the first 3 years and Rs. 28,000 a semester in the 4th and 5th years (<a href="http://www.kvpy.iisc.ernet.in/main/eligibility.htm">eligibility rules</a>).<br />
 The only drawback of KVPY scholarship is that it requires an<br />
undertaking from the student that he/she will not avail any other loans<br />
or scholarships which includes even MCN.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Inspire scheme offers about 10,000 scholarships every year with<br />
Rs.80,000/- each for students pursuing basic science degrees (meaning<br />
only MSc Bio/Phy/Math/Chem are eligible. To get the sholarship you<br />
either need to be:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>top 1% in the 12th grade board exams</li>
<li>or have a JEE(A)/NEET rank less than 10,000</li>
</ul>
