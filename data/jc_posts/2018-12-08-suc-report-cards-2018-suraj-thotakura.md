<h1>Campus Health Improvement</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Student Health Council (Not Fulfilled)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The intent behind the formation of this committee was to spread<br />
awareness and ensure proper healthcare of the students on campus. The<br />
manifesto stated that <em>a team of student representatives will be<br />
inducted at the beginning of the semester along with a faculty in-charge<br />
 to overlook the procedure</em>. However, a formal committee has not yet been constituted, and <strong>no inductions have been announced for this yet.</strong></p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Mental Health (In Progress)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This point in the manifesto talked about increasing the availability<br />
of the counsellor, and that the process to take an appointment would be<br />
simplified. While the availability of the counsellor seems to have<br />
improved, the process for taking an appointment even today appears to<br />
involve taking a form physically from the SWD Office. The General<br />
Secretary stated that the SU had been in talks with psychologists who<br />
can train the faculty in handling students with mental stress and<br />
depression. This manifesto point also talked of an <strong>anonymous portal</strong> that would be added to the <em>SU Website for people to address their problems</em>. However, with the <a href="https://su.bits-hyd.org">SU website</a> still appearing to be <strong>under construction, progress on this front seems unsure.</strong> However, the General Secretary did say that <em>an app is being developed</em><br />
 to hear the grievances of any student facing mental trauma. This will<br />
directly connect the student to a faculty trained for handling such<br />
situations and that the student shall remain anonymous. This is a point<br />
that is common to the manifestos of the President and the GenSec, and<br />
the president said that he's taken up this initiative.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Physical Health  (In Progress)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This point in the manifesto stated that the student representative<br />
would take initiative to organize health camps. In the first semester, a<br />
 blood donation drive (by NSS) and an Eye-Check-up Camp (SU with the<br />
Administration's help) were organised. This point also stated that <strong>articles would be published on seasonal health awareness</strong> and that <strong>regular surveys</strong><br />
 would be conducted and the information from surveys would be given to<br />
the MedC and the Faculty-in-Charge. While health camps did happen over<br />
the semester, the latter two parts of this manifesto are <strong>yet to happen</strong> completely.</p>

<h2>Professional Classes (In Progress)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The General Secretary stated that the plan was to conduct a survey<br />
with the general body regarding their interests and skills and organized<br />
 (paid) classes by professional teachers, based on what a majority of<br />
the General Body wants to learn. The General Secretary stated that he<br />
could not take this up this semester due to other engagements. While the<br />
 General Secretary on 22nd November did put up a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bphcshoutbox/permalink/2127743913954875/">post on ShoutBox</a><br />
 regarding this, this point has not been fulfilled yet. He did however,<br />
say that plans were in place to start work on this in the upcoming<br />
semester.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A set of coding competitions with a generous prize money to encourage<br />
 coding culture on campus will also be organised. Prof. Niranjan Swain<br />
was consulted for this and <strong>prize money of about Rs. 50,000</strong><br />
 was allocated from the administration. These competitions will be<br />
mainly targeted to help people learn skills which will be useful during<br />
their placements.</p>

<h2>Food Outlet Committee (Fulfilled)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A formal committee was constituted to look into the matters related to the eateries on campus. (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bphcshoutbox/permalink/2034445656618035/">notice on ShoutBox</a>).<br />
 The committee, which is headed by the GenSec, consists of H-Reps of all<br />
 the Bhawans and a Convener (this year's convener is Arjun Lokireddy).<br />
The committee has so far issued notices to food outlets through the<br />
Administration mostly related to hygiene issues. The General Secretary<br />
is also looking to bring better food outlets on campus. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RaDgIGpLMFCHsZS9QQfbFGsYPEucPyb5/view">Link to the FOC Charter</a>. A feedback and review form was also floated. The form can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/LlBvt0IQwmtGx9Du1?fbclid=IwAR0HrXiziW5pduxwVXh9TyQQMbW6ThcQCABXGobs2sB_PwrrXoU16P9Zvdo">here.</a>.</p>

<h2>Common Room Meets (Not Fulfilled)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The manifesto of the Secretary promised frequent common room meetings<br />
 to know the grievances of the general body on matters regarding the<br />
campus in general or about their bhavans. This was planned to happen<br />
under the supervision of the warden. Such meetings have not really taken<br />
 place. The General Secretary did mention that they attempted to conduct<br />
 meets in Ram Bhawan, but that nobody showed up. The manifesto point<br />
however promised <strong>frequent</strong> meets, which clearly <strong>didn't happen</strong>.</p>

<h2>Internet Connectivity on Campus (In Progress)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Providing WiFi in Ram and Krishna Bhavans. <strong>New routers have been installed</strong><br />
 and the bandwidth increased from 675mbps to 1gbps. Work is going on to<br />
replace the old network switches (which is about 25% completed), after<br />
which the speed is expected to increase. Also, Cyberoam is being<br />
replaced with another software for better internet connectivity. While<br />
significant work appears to have been done regarding this, it is not<br />
exactly clear how much involvement the SUC might have in this front as<br />
this is <strong>something that comes under the responsibilities of the institute and CCIT as well.</strong></p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Survey in CP (Not Fulfilled)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The point aims at understanding the problems or shortcomings faced by<br />
 the shops at CP by being in constant communication with them. Although a<br />
 survey of the food outlets was done, this hasn't been extended to all<br />
the shops in CP yet. With regard to CP a new coin based laundry service<br />
is <strong>planned</strong> on being set up.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Proper Scheduling of T-Shirts (Fulfilled)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The plan was to draft a schedule for all the clubs, departments and<br />
associations to release their T-Shirts and to ensure that delivery of<br />
TShirts happens on time. While the Atmos merchandise this year was<br />
delivered more or less on time, the first SU TShirt of the year faced<br />
significant delays. The General Secretary said that the delays were<br />
caused due to funds not being released by the Accounts Division, which<br />
took more than 43 days to disburse the funds. However, with the Atmos<br />
TShirts being released on schedule, the General Secretary assured that<br />
the issues have been sorted out.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>SAC (Not Fulfilled)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The General Secretary put forth this agenda point many times during<br />
his campaigning period, promising to speak to the concerned authorities<br />
to keep the SAC functional and open throughout the day and also to<br />
extend the gym timings. Although the General Secretary has <strong>tried</strong> to make this happen <strong>the authorities have rejected this proposal citing a shortage of staff.</strong></p>

<li>‘Best Post - Graduate Research Project’ award.</li>
<li>‘Best Thesis’ award to Ph.D students from each department.<br />

<h2>Intranet Podcast (In Progress)</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to the General Secretary, the Intranet Podcast is <strong>almost ready</strong>. Trials are going on and he is positive that it will become functional by the start of next semester. <strong>A total fund of Rs 2.4L</strong><br />
 of equipment was brought from the administration under this project. A<br />
studio room is also being built. A committee of students and<br />
constitution for this committee which comprises of a tech team and<br />
content team was formed unofficially (inductions will be held next sem).<br />
  Through the podcasts anyone on campus will be able to voice their<br />
opinions on SU or in general. He claims the SUC will connect to campus<br />
though these podcasts. As stated already in his manifesto, the General<br />
Secretary hopes that it will be a good platform for seniors to share<br />
their experiences and also for clubs or societies to hold weekly<br />
programs.</p>
