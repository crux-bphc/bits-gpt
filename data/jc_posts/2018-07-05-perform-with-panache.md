<p>If you want to get your mind blown away by the impeccable acting of<br />
our very talented students, then Ankush Rawat is your go to man! He<br />
leads the brilliant actors and actresses of the Dramatics Club. The club<br />
 brings together drama enthusiasts, irrespective of whether one has an<br />
interest in acting or script writing. Inductions into the club are,<br />
strictly speaking, strict. As a matter of fact, in the second semester<br />
of this academic year, only seven people were inducted into the club, as<br />
 enthusiasts, after inductions that received a lot of interest.</p>

<p>The club conducts several events throughout the year, the headliner<br />
event being Crimson Curtain, the clubâ€™s annual theatrical festival<br />
conducted alongside Pearl. Along with Crimson Curtain, various events<br />
like the Ha-Ha hunt, Samhaara workshop, Nukkad Naatak, DCH Performance,<br />
Mimic-con and many more are conducted, which receive massive<br />
participation.</p>

<p>Other than Crimson Curtain, the club also organises events throughout<br />
 the year. Be it workshops, or their performances during the opening<br />
ceremonies of the three fests, they are bound to keep you hooked. For<br />
example, even though the drama they enacted during the opening ceremony<br />
of ATMOS went on way past midnight, people were so engrossed in their<br />
act, that no one paid any heed to the time!</p>

<p>In the last few years, interest in dramatics has grown considerably<br />
among the students of our campus .This would require the club to conduct<br />
 more workshops to sate their interest! This just goes to show that the<br />
Dramatics Club has a bright future lying ahead of it. After all, who<br />
doesn't like great acting?</p>
