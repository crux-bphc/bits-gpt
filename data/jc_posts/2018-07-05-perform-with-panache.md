If you want to get your mind blown away by the impeccable acting of
our very talented students, then Ankush Rawat is your go to man! He
leads the brilliant actors and actresses of the Dramatics Club. The club
 brings together drama enthusiasts, irrespective of whether one has an
interest in acting or script writing. Inductions into the club are,
strictly speaking, strict. As a matter of fact, in the second semester
of this academic year, only seven people were inducted into the club, as
 enthusiasts, after inductions that received a lot of interest.


The club conducts several events throughout the year, the headliner
event being Crimson Curtain, the clubâ€™s annual theatrical festival
conducted alongside Pearl. Along with Crimson Curtain, various events
like the Ha-Ha hunt, Samhaara workshop, Nukkad Naatak, DCH Performance,
Mimic-con and many more are conducted, which receive massive
participation.


Other than Crimson Curtain, the club also organises events throughout
 the year. Be it workshops, or their performances during the opening
ceremonies of the three fests, they are bound to keep you hooked. For
example, even though the drama they enacted during the opening ceremony
of ATMOS went on way past midnight, people were so engrossed in their
act, that no one paid any heed to the time!


In the last few years, interest in dramatics has grown considerably
among the students of our campus .This would require the club to conduct
 more workshops to sate their interest! This just goes to show that the
Dramatics Club has a bright future lying ahead of it. After all, who
doesn't like great acting?
