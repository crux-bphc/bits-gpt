<p>A General Body Meeting, with the agenda of voting on the motion of<br />
confidence for Dhairya Patel and Shubham Malani was held on February 15,<br />
 2017. This Meeting was called to undo the suspension of their powers<br />
and post by the action of the Examination Committee against them for<br />
malpractice in the 2016-17 first semester comprehensive exams.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this issue of Spotlight, we intend to cover the provisions in the<br />
Students’ Union Constitution for such a motion in such circumstances.</p>

<h1>The Constitution</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Students’ Union Constitution[1] of our campus was last ratified<br />
in the year 2013. This ratified version is, for all practical purposes,<br />
the same as the earlier version (2010 edition) because no amendments<br />
were done to it, at least in the sections and clauses that we intend to<br />
discuss in the current article. The 2013 ratification happened only<br />
because, according to the Constitution itself, it has to be ratified<br />
every three years[2].</p>

<h2>The Three Sections</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are three sections in the constitution that relate to<br />
eligibility to hold an office in the SUC and provisions for impeachments<br />
 and suspensions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/journal-club/wiki-data/blob/master/news/spotlight/2017-vote-of-confidence.md#section-k-elections"></a></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Section K (Elections)</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Section K deals with elections and conditions of suspension from a post.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In Clause 5[3], it says that any member of the Students’ Union<br />
Council “shall cease to hold their respective offices if they fail to<br />
fulfil any of the eligibility criteria as mentioned in the relevant<br />
clause(s) of this section.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In addition, Clause 18[4], prevents any SUC member who has been<br />
“found guilty under any offence by the Disciplinary Committee and has<br />
been charged with an offence under the category of Tier-I or above” from<br />
 holding office.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/journal-club/wiki-data/blob/master/news/spotlight/2017-vote-of-confidence.md#section-p-removal-from-office"></a></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Section P (Removal from Office)</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Section P deals with Removal from Office[5]. This section supports<br />
the above section in saying that any elected found guilty under any<br />
“offence by the Disciplinary Committee and has been charged with an<br />
offence under the category of Tier-I or above during their term of<br />
office, they will be impeached immediately.”<br />
The issue with the application of Sections K and Section P is that the<br />
Examination Committee was formed in the year 2014, a year after the<br />
Constitution was last ratified. Therefore, it is not clear under what<br />
category an offence under this Committee falls under. Also, it is<br />
important to note that the concerned students were awarded Examination<br />
Committee actions and not Disciplinary Committee actions, which are not<br />
classified into any of the tiers.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/journal-club/wiki-data/blob/master/news/spotlight/2017-vote-of-confidence.md#section-s-flagrant-violations"></a></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Section S (Flagrant Violations)</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Section S of the Constitution deals with Flagrant Violations. This section says that</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>· “In the event of a flagrant violation being committed, the person<br />
responsible for the same shall cease to hold the relevant post” and<br />
· He/she shall return to the post “if a motion of confidence is passed<br />
in his favour by at least two–thirds of the concerned electorate.”<br />
· “[T]he motion of confidence shall have to be initiated by at least<br />
one-third of the concerned electorate.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Simply put, if a person in office has committed flagrant violations,<br />
they will be suspended from the post they hold. However, they can<br />
re-assume the post if a Motion of Confidence is passed in their favour.<br />
But, for the Motion of Confidence to be initiated in the first place,<br />
1/3rd of the General Body has to be present.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Two points are noteworthy here:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A flagrant violation has <strong>not been defined</strong> in the<br />
Constitution. It could have been either intended to be a violation by a<br />
post holder in his/her capacity as the bearer of that office or a<br />
violation anywhere, including Unfair Means[6]. It has to be assumed for<br />
now that this has been left to the interpretation of the EC. Yet, the<br />
importance of defining ‘Flagrant Violation’ in form of an amendment<br />
shouldn’t be discounted.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The section mentions that the quorum required for the initiation is<br />
33%[7] rather than 10% (with was the quorum that was deemed required for<br />
 the motion in discussion). On a request for comment on this, the EC<br />
told us the reduced quorum was recommended by the Associate Dean, SWD,<br />
Prof. SS Deshmukh and the Chief Warden, Dr. Kumar Pranav Narayan.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>**The Question of Separate Vote:**Another point of interest in the<br />
GBM of Feb. 15th is that a separate vote of confidence for each of the<br />
post holders wasn’t taken. Rather, a single vote for both together was<br />
taken. Though objections weren’t raised in this regard in this situation<br />
 (probably because everyone was in favour of both the candidates), this<br />
has a potential of setting a precedence wherein a GB member will have to<br />
 give vote of confidence to all the persons even if they intend to give<br />
it to only one.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Though no constitutional provision was violated in the process of<br />
conducting the Vote of Confidence, the vagueness of a couple of<br />
provisions led EC to appropriately interpret the Constitution. This<br />
vagueness is caused either due to formation of a new committee<br />
(Examination Committee) or undefined terms (like ‘Minor and Major’,<br />
‘Flagrant Violations’). Therefore, elimination of this vagueness is more<br />
 needed now than ever before, lest contradictions arise in future.</p>
