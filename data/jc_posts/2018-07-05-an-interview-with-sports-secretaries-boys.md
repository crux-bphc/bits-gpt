<p><strong>What clubs and departments have you worked in so far?</strong>&nbsp;I have been a part of DoSM, DePP and Firewallz since my first year. I have also worked in DoSH, DoRA, and Department of Arts and Deco in my second year.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of leadership experience do you have? If you get elected to the post of sports secretary, how do you think this experience will aid you in doing your job?</strong>&nbsp;I was a team lead in DoSM during ATMOS and brought in the highest sponsorship ever. I had also brought in contingents from 6 colleges for ARENA, one of which was a 100-member contingent, which wasn’t even there in the ARENA database. I was a part of Glitterati OC and Mr. and Ms. Pearl OC. I am also the vice-captain of BPHC Kabaddi team. The experience has been indispensable in teaching me how to work with people of different mindsets. It has also taught me how to bring the best out of each person. It’s imperative for any member of the SUC to have such skills, since the entire FOB will have to come together for great results.</p>

<p><strong>What qualities you have, which make you a suitable candidate for sports secretary?</strong>&nbsp;I know the inner workings of the departments, how to make the fests profitable and how to run an effective publicity campaign. Also, being the vice-captain of the Kabaddi team honed the leadership skills in me. So, I think the experience coupled with the leadership skills make me a suitable candidate for the post.</p>

<p><strong>As sports secretary, what is your general vision? Any particular plans for our sports fest Arena?</strong>&nbsp;Until now, we have confined ourselves to college sports. But I would like to take our sports to the professional level. As for Arena, for which I have worked a lot previously and bought in a sponsorship of about 3 lakh in kind, I think it is only a reflection of how good the sporting culture in our campus is. I am also thinking of introducing an Arena trophy for the contingent that wins most games, which I am hoping would increase the footfall of the fest.</p>

<p><strong>What clubs and departments have you worked in so far?</strong>&nbsp;I'm in the cricket team, I’ve represented the campus in BOSM 2016 last year and won silver. Also, I’ve worked in 6 departments- DoSH, DoRA, LSD, DoSM, DePP and Firewallz.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>What kind of leadership experience do you have?</strong>&nbsp;In DePP and DoSM I had a team of juniors working under me, and it was a lot of work and responsibility. Also any event in Football which took place, I would be given the responsibility. Any kinds of delays which happened I had to take care of it. So, I had a team in Arena working under me and everything was smooth sailing. Also, I managed the blitzkrieg event which could not have been successfully done all alone.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>What makes you think these experiences would help you if you get elected?</strong>&nbsp;What I’ve learnt so far is that where the mistakes have taken place in whatever I’ve done for the campus so far and that I think is the most important thing. Overcoming the ones mistakes is the most important thing. In all my experiences I’ve learnt the places where one could go wrong and have tried my best to overcome them. So now I’m confident that if I’m elected the sports secretary I’ll know the things one could do and not do for the best. I’m now sure that I’ll be able to tackle all the problems facing me in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Any significant work outside the clubs and departments?</strong>&nbsp;I co-organized the Redbull 3-on-3 basketball tournament also many other sponsored events from outside the campus.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>And what is your general/crude vision for the campus?</strong>&nbsp;I’d want to so everyone of this campus participate in at least one event in their campus life and make sure the person who is interested will have ample opportunities to do so.</p>
