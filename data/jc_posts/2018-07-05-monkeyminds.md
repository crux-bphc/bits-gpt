<p>To be the calm in a storm is an incredibly powerful thing to do. It’s<br />
 also necessary. The world has morphed into an unhinged monster,<br />
constantly demanding the movement of its poor inhabitants. Not just<br />
physical movement, but the movement of our minds, which has become<br />
almost as critical for survival as air. There is always a deadline to<br />
meet, always a task to do. Wherever in the world you are at this moment,<br />
 you have somewhere else to be in an hour and something else to do in<br />
fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>All this is within a world that is sinking under the melting ice<br />
caps, choking under blankets of smog and steadily toasting itself to<br />
death. The Earth may be here to stay, but our World is dying. And so, we<br />
 run all over a giant sphere as fast as our legs can carry us while also<br />
 running tiny circles in our minds. Perhaps we hope to find peace by all<br />
 this running, which is evidently a useless exercise. We cannot leave<br />
the planet, neither can we be truly happy (without using psychedelics,<br />
of course).</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the concept of mindfulness has received a lot<br />
of attention from neuroscientists and psychologists looking to find the<br />
source of happiness. Essentially, mindfulness, is the ‘stepping out’ of<br />
mind movement. According to Scientific American, “the concept of<br />
mindfulness involves focusing on your present situation and state of<br />
mind.” According to Master Oogway (who is, of course, more credible),<br />
“Yesterday is History, Tomorrow is a Mystery…but Today is a Gift. That<br />
is why it is called ‘Present’.”</p>

<p>By making a habit of focusing deeply and completely on the activity<br />
being done in the present moment, without being involved in the mental<br />
chatter, one can experience a sense of well-being and peace.</p>

<p>However, research is woefully crippled due to flexible definitions of<br />
 ‘mindfulness’, lack of standardization and the highly subjective nature<br />
 of the experience. We must remain cautious enough not to buy into the<br />
hype. The benefits investigated through trials are many, ranging from<br />
enhanced cognitive function to preserving the tips of chromosomes. But<br />
the nature and methods of those trials must be considered carefully.</p>

<p>Even so, we could all use a little calm. For a few minutes a day,<br />
perhaps you could pay attention to the way you walk down your wing. You<br />
could notice the feeling of your feet touching the floor and the fabric<br />
of the pockets touching your hands. You could sense your beating heart<br />
and your lungs expand as you breathe deeply. Let the big picture hit you<br />
 once in a while (without using psychedelics, of course) and become the<br />
calm in the storm for that moment.</p>
