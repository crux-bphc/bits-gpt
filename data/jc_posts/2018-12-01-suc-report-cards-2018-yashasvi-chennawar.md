Collaborate With The Clubs for Workshops: Fulfilled


The motive was to familiarise the freshers with the working of
various clubs on campus and to ensure that the induction process was
done smoothly. During the Fervour week, numerous workshops and events
were conducted by the clubs, the schedule of which was extensively
planned by the Cultural Secretary. (link to schedule)





Automatic Vending Machines for Sanitary Napkins: Fulfilled


This point is common to the manifestos of both, the Cultural
Secretary (Girls) and the President. The necessary contacts were claimed
 to have been procured by the President and upon mutual agreement, the
matter was taken forward by the President while she was asked to look
after the Orientation programme. A sanitary napkin dispenser has been
installed in the washroom in the library.





Cultural and Sanskriti Magazines: In Progress


To celebrate the cultural diversity on campus and to bring out more
participation from the regional associations, a team has been set up
which has been set into working and bringing out a magazine which has
faculty giving a few inputs. The magazine aims to document all the
cultural events. This magazine is independent of Journal Club, and the
Cultural Secretary claims she has assembled a separate team for it.





Creating a Culture of Martial Arts for Females: In Progress


As of now, there is a martial arts class being conducted in the SAC
which is an initiative taken up by the NSS, the Cultural Secretary has
claimed to have approach a few individuals with professional training in
 order to conduct similar classes/workshops for females in the next
semester depending on the number of enthusiasts.





Professionals Offering Classes for Special Skills: In Progress


The Cultural Secretary also stated that the SU intends to have a few
classes conducted for skill development. Hopefully, these workshops will
 be conducted by seniors in various clubs who have received professional
 training. If not, there are plans of roping in a professional from
outside the campus for a nominal fee, depending on the number of
enthusiasts. The General Secretary has also asked about the interest of
the General Body in specific skills recently.





Introduction of Mini Comic-Con, and Conducting Prom Night: In Progress


The candidate plans on having a mini comic con on campus in the next
semester but the feasibility of doing so depends entirely on the budget
allocation. The prom night was conducted during the Fervour week for the
 BE freshers. The candidate has, besides scheduling the events,
coordinated and roped in Red Bull as a sponsor.





Increasing the Scale of Informal Events and Conducting Shangrila: In Progress


The candidate intends to conduct various informal nights viz.
dramatics, music, dance to name a few. Keeping in mind the commitments
and priorities of the relevant clubs, the plan of having events on 3
consecutive nights has been dropped for this semester. While the
dramatics and music nights were conducted this semester, the rest of the
 events are slated to be conducted in the following semester.





Initiation of Ethnic Food Fest: In Progress


The Cultural Secretary said intended to have food trucks which cater
food celebrating various cultures during Shangrila or Sanskriti. She
claims to have procured contacts and tried her best to bring in food
trucks during Sanskriti, as a result of which there was a dosa and chaat stall amongst the other fast food stalls. While this was not exactly the promised "ethnic food fest", it was a good start.





Updating the GB on Cultural Activites: Not Fulfilled


While Chennawar said that a group Culturals@BPHC
 already exists, it is not very active as of now due to the lack of
awareness amongst the general body. She plans to float a notice
regarding the same on BPHC Shoutbox in the beginning of the next
semester and make the page active during Pearl. Here, the general body
will be informed of all the cultural events taking place on campus.
However, considering the fact that almost half the tenure of the SUC is
done, and the page is yet to be active, this point clearly haasn't been
fulfilled this semester.





More Magazine Subscriptions &amp; Sanskriti Magazine: Not Fulfilled


The Cultural Secretary intended to take subscriptions for magazines
in hostels, similar to the existing newspapers in Bhawans. This hasn't
manifested yet. The Sanskriti Magazine being referred to in this point
has been included in a previous point.





Anaemia Screening for Girls: Fulfilled


Anaemia screening was done in the first semester by the NSS in
association with the Lions’ Club. The Cultural Secretary mentioned that
she is ready to collaborate with NSS for the same and hopes to conduct a
 few more screening sessions in the next semester. The result of the
first screening showed that the number of anaemic girls was zero and
hence no food counter was set-up. If necessary she seemed confident of
pushing for a separate counter specifically for the anaemic people. Such
 a counter (with green leafy vegetables) was set up last year as well,
after a screening identifed low iron levels during her tenure as an SMC
member.





Women Specific Hackathons, Marathons and More: Not Fulfilled


She claims that this hasn't been fulfilled so far due to a lack of
participation and a packed schedule this semster. She is ready to
conduct such events in the next semester if there is enough
participation.





Movies in Common Room: Not Fulfilled


The chances of this being fulfilled are bleak mainly due to the issue
 of piracy. This was a concern that was also raised during Soapbox
before elections last year. The only alternative offered by the
candidate was to stream movies from YouTube.





Portal to Record Participation in Clubs: Not Fulfilled


The Cultural Secretary wants to create a portal similar to one on the
 SWD website wherein achievements are recorded. She also hopes to
increase the travel reimbursement for the winners (currently 50%) if
budget permits. However, the SWD achievements section is something that
has existed before the start of this year, and has not been used much so
 far.





Increase Participation in Literary Events During Renaissance: In Progress


In order to increase participation, there is a plan of incentivising
literary events during Renaissance, where additional points can be
traded in for merchandise.





Production House: Not Fulfilled


The production house was primarily intended to be a space for the
performing clubs. This is still unfulfilled due to a lack of space. The
Cultural Secretary was confident that a room would be allocated for it
if she manages to find space for it.





ME Freshers' Night 2018: Not Fulfilled


The ME fresher night wasn’t conducted due to certain issues that
arose with the postponement of the BE freshers’. She also claims to have
 spoken to a few ME students who have expressed hectic academic
schedules as a reason for their lack of participation in the
club-related activities on campus. Thus, a lack of incentives prevented
this event from happening.





Incentivising Pearl: In Progress


To improve participation in Pearl, there is a plan to award points to all the winners besides the prize money which can be traded off with Pearl merchandise against a fixed price.





Outside The Manifesto


Besides working on the points in her manifesto, Chennawar said that she worked on a variety of other initiatives, like:



installation of solar panels,
promoting stand-up club and cooking club.  (Cooking Club set up a
stall during Atmos this year, and also got permission to use the
kitchen).
helping in organising the logistics involved in Comic Con (Hyderabad)
extension of library timings
sending a contingent from BPHC to Waves.
RO Water Purifiers (the SU has apparently been pushing this for a while)
