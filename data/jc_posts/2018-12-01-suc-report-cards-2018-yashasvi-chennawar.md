<h2>Collaborate With The Clubs for Workshops: Fulfilled</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The motive was to familiarise the freshers with the working of<br />
various clubs on campus and to ensure that the induction process was<br />
done smoothly. During the Fervour week, numerous workshops and events<br />
were conducted by the clubs, the schedule of which was extensively<br />
planned by the Cultural Secretary. (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=pcb.2002504076478860&amp;type=1">link to schedule</a>)</p>

<h2>Automatic Vending Machines for Sanitary Napkins: Fulfilled</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This point is common to the manifestos of both, the Cultural<br />
Secretary (Girls) and the President. The necessary contacts were claimed<br />
 to have been procured by the President and upon mutual agreement, the<br />
matter was taken forward by the President while she was asked to look<br />
after the Orientation programme. A sanitary napkin dispenser has been<br />
installed in the washroom in the library.</p>

<h2>Cultural and Sanskriti Magazines: In Progress</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To celebrate the cultural diversity on campus and to bring out more<br />
participation from the regional associations, a team has been set up<br />
which has been set into working and bringing out a magazine which has<br />
faculty giving a few inputs. The magazine aims to document all the<br />
cultural events. This magazine is independent of Journal Club, and the<br />
Cultural Secretary claims she has assembled a separate team for it.</p>

<h2>Creating a Culture of Martial Arts for Females: In Progress</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As of now, there is a martial arts class being conducted in the SAC<br />
which is an initiative taken up by the NSS, the Cultural Secretary has<br />
claimed to have approach a few individuals with professional training in<br />
 order to conduct similar classes/workshops for females in the next<br />
semester depending on the number of enthusiasts.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Professionals Offering Classes for Special Skills: In Progress</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Cultural Secretary also stated that the SU intends to have a few<br />
classes conducted for skill development. Hopefully, these workshops will<br />
 be conducted by seniors in various clubs who have received professional<br />
 training. If not, there are plans of roping in a professional from<br />
outside the campus for a nominal fee, depending on the number of<br />
enthusiasts. The General Secretary has also asked about the interest of<br />
the General Body in specific skills recently.</p>

<h2>Introduction of Mini Comic-Con, and Conducting Prom Night: In Progress</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The candidate plans on having a mini comic con on campus in the next<br />
semester but the feasibility of doing so depends entirely on the budget<br />
allocation. The prom night was conducted during the Fervour week for the<br />
 BE freshers. The candidate has, besides scheduling the events,<br />
coordinated and roped in Red Bull as a sponsor.</p>

<h2>Increasing the Scale of Informal Events and Conducting Shangrila: In Progress</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The candidate intends to conduct various informal nights viz.<br />
dramatics, music, dance to name a few. Keeping in mind the commitments<br />
and priorities of the relevant clubs, the plan of having events on 3<br />
consecutive nights has been dropped for this semester. While the<br />
dramatics and music nights were conducted this semester, the rest of the<br />
 events are slated to be conducted in the following semester.</p>

<h2>Initiation of Ethnic Food Fest: In Progress</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Cultural Secretary said intended to have food trucks which cater<br />
food celebrating various cultures during Shangrila or Sanskriti. She<br />
claims to have procured contacts and tried her best to bring in food<br />
trucks during Sanskriti, as a result of which there was a dosa and <em>chaat</em> stall amongst the other fast food stalls. While this was not exactly the promised "ethnic food fest", it was a good start.</p>

<h2>Updating the GB on Cultural Activites: Not Fulfilled</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While Chennawar said that a group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/414477292081168/">Culturals@BPHC</a><br />
 already exists, it is not very active as of now due to the lack of<br />
awareness amongst the general body. She plans to float a notice<br />
regarding the same on BPHC Shoutbox in the beginning of the next<br />
semester and make the page active during Pearl. Here, the general body<br />
will be informed of all the cultural events taking place on campus.<br />
However, considering the fact that almost half the tenure of the SUC is<br />
done, and the page is yet to be active, this point clearly haasn't been<br />
fulfilled this semester.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>More Magazine Subscriptions &amp; Sanskriti Magazine: Not Fulfilled</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Cultural Secretary intended to take subscriptions for magazines<br />
in hostels, similar to the existing newspapers in Bhawans. This hasn't<br />
manifested yet. The Sanskriti Magazine being referred to in this point<br />
has been included in a previous point.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Anaemia Screening for Girls: Fulfilled</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Anaemia screening was done in the first semester by the NSS in<br />
association with the Lionsâ€™ Club. The Cultural Secretary mentioned that<br />
she is ready to collaborate with NSS for the same and hopes to conduct a<br />
 few more screening sessions in the next semester. The result of the<br />
first screening showed that the number of anaemic girls was zero and<br />
hence no food counter was set-up. If necessary she seemed confident of<br />
pushing for a separate counter specifically for the anaemic people. Such<br />
 a counter (with green leafy vegetables) was set up last year as well,<br />
after a screening identifed low iron levels during her tenure as an SMC<br />
member.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Women Specific Hackathons, Marathons and More: Not Fulfilled</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>She claims that this hasn't been fulfilled so far due to a lack of<br />
participation and a packed schedule this semster. She is ready to<br />
conduct such events in the next semester if there is enough<br />
participation.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Movies in Common Room: Not Fulfilled</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The chances of this being fulfilled are bleak mainly due to the issue<br />
 of piracy. This was a concern that was also raised during Soapbox<br />
before elections last year. The only alternative offered by the<br />
candidate was to stream movies from YouTube.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Portal to Record Participation in Clubs: Not Fulfilled</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Cultural Secretary wants to create a portal similar to one on the<br />
 SWD website wherein achievements are recorded. She also hopes to<br />
increase the travel reimbursement for the winners (currently 50%) if<br />
budget permits. However, the SWD achievements section is something that<br />
has existed before the start of this year, and has not been used much so<br />
 far.</p>

<h2>Increase Participation in Literary Events During Renaissance: In Progress</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In order to increase participation, there is a plan of incentivising<br />
literary events during Renaissance, where additional points can be<br />
traded in for merchandise.</p>

<h2>Production House: Not Fulfilled</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The production house was primarily intended to be a space for the<br />
performing clubs. This is still unfulfilled due to a lack of space. The<br />
Cultural Secretary was confident that a room would be allocated for it<br />
if she manages to find space for it.</p>

<h2>ME Freshers' Night 2018: Not Fulfilled</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ME fresher night wasnâ€™t conducted due to certain issues that<br />
arose with the postponement of the BE freshersâ€™. She also claims to have<br />
 spoken to a few ME students who have expressed hectic academic<br />
schedules as a reason for their lack of participation in the<br />
club-related activities on campus. Thus, a lack of incentives prevented<br />
this event from happening.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Besides working on the points in her manifesto, Chennawar said that she worked on a variety of other initiatives, like:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>installation of solar panels,</li>
<li>promoting stand-up club and cooking club.  (Cooking Club set up a<br />
stall during Atmos this year, and also got permission to use the<br />
kitchen).</li>
<li>helping in organising the logistics involved in Comic Con (Hyderabad)</li>
<li>extension of library timings</li>
<li>sending a contingent from BPHC to Waves.</li>
<li>RO Water Purifiers (the SU has apparently been pushing this for a while)</li>
