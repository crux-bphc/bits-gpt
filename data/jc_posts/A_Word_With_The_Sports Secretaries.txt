Aastha  :As the sports secretary my job is to make  sure that the fest runs smoothly. Every little detail is discussed in  the Fest Organizing Body meets. The FOB is putting in a lot of effort  for ARENA. And also, with Inter-BITS happening this year, the  responsibilities have multiplied as we have to co-ordinate with the  captains of other campuses of BITS and make sure they too have a  memorable fest. We also have to co-ordinate with the teams for issues  relating jerseys or equipment that they might require for practice. 
Kritanshu: We also have to make sure that the FOB is on  the same page regarding all matters and also co-ordinate with the  president and the general secretary. Everyone is kept in a loop.
Aastha: The actual work starts 3 months in advance just after ATMOS is over. 
Kritanshu: Also, it is harder to manage ARENA because  we do not have a lot of time. There are comprehensive exams and semester  end holidays which take up almost two-thirds of the time.
Aastha: Yes this is a very hectic time because we 
have to look after the all the details and make sure there aren’t any 
last minute glitches in organization. This year it is even more 
challenging.
Aastha: As I already said we have inter-BITS for the  first time in our campus which is a huge deal. With players from other  BITS campuses coming, ARENA is bigger than ever before. We have also  planned a separate inauguration and closing ceremony only for BITSIANS.  There will be a lot of excitement as we are having sister matches apart  from the regular ones that will be going on. 
Kritanshu: This year we have also planned 2 workshops.  One is the self-defence workshop and the other is he power yoga  workshop. We are hoping for a good response. For Pro-Shows also we have  planned a lot but it would be better if it is revealed at the proper  time.
Kritanshu: I have always had an inclination towards cricket and. I have played for my school team and also for the local club in my city.
Kritanshu: I think cricket is a very intelligent 
game. You always have to be a step ahead of your opponent. Being a 
bowler I have to think like the batsman and then outthink him. You also 
feel happy when you are representing your college and you feel 
responsible for the ten other players that are on your team when you 
know that every ball you bowl affects the state of the match.
Aastha: I really want to request the general public  to come out and support the players in large numbers. Because when you  see a large number if people cheering for you your morale boosts up and  you believe in your ability to deliver. The players themselves are  working day and night and if they have a cheering crowd they will be  motivated to give their very best. 
Kritanshu: To the players I would like to say ‘Give your very best’. You have worked so hard. And this is the moment to deliver.
Aastha: ARENA is a sports fest. Sports is something 
that connects everyone regardless of their other inclinations. At ARENA 
not only the players but also the non-playing community can have a lot 
of excitement as they support their team and their sport. For example if
 you are watching the final of the basketball game and it is a 
nail-biting finish. The rush you feel in such times cannot be felt in 
other fests. That’s why I would again request everyone to come out in 
large numbers to support the players.
