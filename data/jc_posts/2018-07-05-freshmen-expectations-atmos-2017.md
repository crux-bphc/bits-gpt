time.</p>

<p><strong>Rohit Dwivedula</strong>: First off, the theme - Cyberpunk ("A Neon Dystopia") sounds <em>really</em><br />
 cool! I am expecting the campus to undergo a wild transition to look<br />
like a tech-controlled future with no personal freedom - maybe there'll<br />
be telescreens (like those of 1984)? Or maybe models of the huge<br />
fire-hoses from Fahrenheit 451? Or maybe a view of the planet as seen in<br />
 HGW's Time Machine. On another unrelated side, now that Rs. 1200 is<br />
being cut from everyone's mess balance (possibly against the will of a<br />
significant %age of people on campus) I <em>expect</em> ATMOS to be<br />
highly profitable this year, without any sort of loss happening. Last<br />
year, ATMOS could net a profit of Rs.10 lakh; this year they have a paid<br />
 pro-show (even for BPHCians), more sponsorship + cash we saved - so<br />
even doubling the profit could be an expectation a reasonable person<br />
could have. Other than this, a main expectation I have of ATMOS is<br />
hospitality - loads of people will be on campus to experience a BITSian<br />
fest - I hope all of us are gracious enough hosts and uphold the ideals<br />
of Athiti Devo Bhava to the fullest extent. And finally..... FOOD! I<br />
hope this year's ATMOS has way more options for food and eating than<br />
previous ones - I'm already tired of the mess food. I hope ATMOS 2K17 to<br />
 be a fun-filled, exhilarating, seventy-two hours of non-stop fun and<br />
enjoyment for all tech geeks.</p>

<p><strong>Sai Sharath Chandra</strong>: To be frank this is the first<br />
time I am going to a technical fest - I am generally not so interested<br />
in technology so I hope this brings up something in me.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shreyansh</strong>: It would be a very exciting, amazing, and<br />
 obviously unforgettable. We would enjoy our heart out there and feel<br />
each and every moment to its fullest. All the events, competitions,<br />
conferences etc. would be highly attractive, thus leading to rise in<br />
footfall for our cultural fest ATMOS 2k17.</p>

<p><strong>Utsav Kaushal</strong>:  Since it is a tech fest i definitely<br />
 expect some mind boggling technical exhibitions. Apart from that I<br />
expect some contests for touch typing, coding etc. Guidance in the topic<br />
 of "how to set up and manage an e-commerce company" would also be<br />
great.</p>
