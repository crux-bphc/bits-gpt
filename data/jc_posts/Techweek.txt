Techweek



            











The second edition of Tech-Week, the intra-college technical fest, 
which was between the 4th and 11th of February featured a host of talks,
 events and workshops.
The technical associations and clubs of campus organised talks by 
eminent personalities. For instance, Panacea had a “Panel Discussion on 
Entrepreneurship” by two of the very successful Pharmapreneurs: Mr. 
Rakesh Gupta (BITS Alumnus), CEO of Nature Velvet Lifecare and Mr. Anup 
Soans, Pharma L&amp;D Facilitator and Editor of MedicineMan – a popular 
pharma magazine. Spectrum, the Physics Association, organized a talk by 
Professor Kannan Ramaswamy on “Campus life for Academic Excellence”, on 
how students can make most of the resources available on campus.
Coming to events, TechWeek saw quizzing events like In-Quiz-Tive, the
 Auto Quiz and Online Cryptics. Other events included “The Fault in Our 
Movies”, to spot the scientific inaccuracies in films and competitions 
like Plan B, Design Competition by MEA, N-Crypton, and Mathefia by 
Axiom.
Workshops, too, generated a lot of interest and participation in 
campus – from CruX’s DIY Workshop to troubleshoot basic computer 
problems, to the Competitive Coding Bootcamps, to a series of classes on
 Neural Networks, TechWeek once again showed the considerable interest 
of learning and becoming technically knowledgeable.
A lot of effort had gone into organizing the events in such a planned
 way – the limited time slots available, however, caused clashes between
 events, putting the general body into a dilemma on which event to go 
to, although some events were rescheduled to accommodate the time 
clashes with other events.
