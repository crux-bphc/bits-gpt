<p>The second edition of LaunchPad was held on 18th February, in our<br />
campus. BITS Pilani is no new player when it comes to producing the most<br />
 innovative minds of the nation. Organised by E-Cell, the event aims at<br />
being a grand confluence of various elements of the start-up ecosystem.</p>

<p>Like all budding fests, LaunchPad had its issues and challenges too.<br />
In the inaugural edition last year, E-Cell faced logistical challenges,<br />
and difficulty in getting participation - challenges that plague almost<br />
every venture or start-up - but it worked out in the end, after months<br />
of solid work put in by the LaunchPad OC.</p>

<p>There were plans to host the second edition of E-Cell at a venue<br />
outside campus in Hyderabad, but the idea was scrapped considering the<br />
very motive of E-Cell was to promote the start-up culture on-campus. The<br />
 first edition of LaunchPad, in 2017, was a two-day event. This year,<br />
however, to make the summit more productive and enriching, it was<br />
decided to reduce the number of speakers and make it a one- day<br />
experience - increasing the focus on content and ensuring a non-stop<br />
compact summit with a multitude of events planned to great detail.</p>

<p>Buoyed by the quality of speakers in its inaugural edition, this<br />
edition of LaunchPad hosted a stellar line-up of influencers which<br />
include Jayesh Ranjan, IT Secretary to the Telangana Government, Hari<br />
Menon, CEO of BigBasket, Aparajita Roy, RA from RBI, Satyarth<br />
Priyadarshi, Marketing Head of JioChat, Jincy Samuel, COO of Coinsecure,<br />
 and Nandini Vaidyanathan, EX-CEO of UTV.</p>
