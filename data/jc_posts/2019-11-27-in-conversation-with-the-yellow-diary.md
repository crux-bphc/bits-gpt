<p>The Yellow Diary is a Mumbai-based indie musical group rapidly growing into the Indian music circuit. The band, consisting of five members, has been taking the country by storm through their powerful lyrics, evocative music videos, and emotive music. The Yellow Diary performed at BITS Hyderabad on the 19th October, during ATMOS 2019. After their scintillating performance, we at Journal Club caught up with them to find out more about their story. </p>

<p><strong>Q. You’ve often spoken about how each of your songs is linked to an experience. What story is “Marz” linked to?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>”Marz”<br />
wasn’t linked to a particular story; its source was a conversation<br />
that I once had with a friend about the story of how he met a girl<br />
he’s dating right now. Many of us don't believe in love and<br />
"feelings". This guy would always deny the fact that his<br />
feelings existed. He was always in denial until the girl asked him<br />
out one day and he realized that, "Oh shit. This is real."</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The<br />
idea of the song struck me when I thought about what would’ve<br />
happened if that girl hadn’t asked him out. He might, or might not<br />
have figured out he was in love later. I wondered if he would’ve<br />
found anybody else, or ever understood what love was.</p>

<p><strong>Q. The idea for the music video is incredibly bold- not something one expects when they listen to the audio first. How did you come up with that stark contrast in the concept?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The<br />
video was conceptualized by our amazing director. Marz, like most of<br />
our songs, has very layered lyrics, and at its core, is about a<br />
dilemma between the heart and the mind. We wanted to talk about a<br />
different side of the song and focus on the dilemma from a different<br />
perspective. That's what you see in the video; the girl's dilemma<br />
over whether she should save the people or not. It was our director's<br />
concept and it came out beautifully.</p>

<p><strong>Q. How did you come to collaborate with Sony Music and how did that change your life as a band?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The<br />
beauty of today's day is that the Internet allows our music to be<br />
available to everyone at the click of a button. That's exactly what<br />
happened with Sony: they found out about us through our music. They<br />
came across Marz, Bhawri Chori, and Sada and realized that there was<br />
a lot of potential in the band. Marz was actually the song that made<br />
things happen for us.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A<br />
great thing about having Sony Music India as a partner is that, even<br />
though they're in a mainstream landscape, they're willing to back an<br />
indie band and push their sound out to the masses. They're also super<br />
artist-friendly. Everything we have is a collaborative effort based<br />
around a discussion. People usually have some prejudice built up<br />
around artists vs labels, but the reality is that it is a very<br />
peaceful collaboration.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Today,<br />
people were singing along with us. Had it not been for the exposure<br />
Sony has managed to get for us, that would not have been possible.<br />
Sony has been the best partner we could have.</p>

<p><em>Vaibhav Pani is the guitarist and co-composer for the Mumbai-based band. His journey to the band involved a huge leap career-wise, going from an IT consultant to a musician.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Q. (To Vaibhav) You had a stark change from your previous job to what you do right now. How did you make the switch work?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It’s<br />
interesting, because when I was working as a consultant I knew that<br />
when the time was right, I would make that leap of faith as a<br />
musician. I guess the moment was right, and more importantly, the<br />
people were right. Our music is a by-product of our friendship and<br />
our instant chemistry meant that there was no other choice left for<br />
us. Honestly, I haven’t regretted one moment since then. When the<br />
time is right, you just know to make that jump.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><strong>Q. In our college, several people are trying to progress in different non-academic fields apart from their domain, like music or writing. What advice would you give those people pursuing their passion as offbeat career choices?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The<br />
best thing you can do is to just continue doing it and to try and<br />
strike a balance between what you are in for and what your passion<br />
is. But primarily, just have fun with it. If you stop having fun with<br />
your passion, then the passion is going to die out on its own.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Moreover,<br />
I think patience is one of the most important things you need to<br />
have, especially with an offbeat career. People tend to look up to<br />
people who have already achieved a certain amount of success and when<br />
they don’t get that in their first few years of trying, it’s very<br />
frustrating. Everyone goes through a different journey to get to<br />
where they reach. Living through that journey only makes the success<br />
a lot more enjoyable. Weighing it out, having faith in oneself,<br />
pushing through, coming out and talking is very important.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I<br />
think there is one more thing that’s crucial and that’s to stay<br />
aware of what’s happening around you. Besides knowing what your<br />
passion is and working towards it, you should also know what you<br />
deserve and where you’re at. In our minds, we dream of immense<br />
success, but it is equally important to know how much of it we can<br />
grasp and hold on to.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Q. At some point, you'll have to take that leap of faith to plunge yourself into your passion. How would you know when it is the right time?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> There is always a right time. The thing is that all of us have really supportive parents and that's been really helpful. Pani's parents are from the film industry and his sisters are actors too. He lives in a family of freelancers, so they were very understanding. In fact, he was the odd one out doing engineering. I was always that one kid who was doing his own thing but after a point, when you show growth and commitment towards your work, things fall into place. That cliche they say that if you make your passion your profession, you will never work a day in your life holds very true for us.</p>
