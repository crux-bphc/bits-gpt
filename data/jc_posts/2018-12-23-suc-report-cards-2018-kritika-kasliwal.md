Sports Secretary (Girls) of BPHC during the Academic Year 2018-19.




Help Initialization: In Progress


The idea behind this was to ease the introduction of new sports on
campus (Girls' Football, Tennis and Ultimate Frisbee) by "organising
workshops" and focussing on  "coaching and provision of required
equipment", ideas which are slightly similar to points 4 and 5
 in this manifesto. This year a Tennis Girls' team (consisting of only
two girls) was formed, and the Sports' Secretary (girls) said that steps
 have been taken to initiate a Futsal team as well.





Orientation: Fulfilled


This manifesto point proposed to organize "at least 2 workshops for
each sport in the first month...". The Sports Secretary said that this
would improve the existing culture and build the sports spirit among the
 freshers. Workshops for most the sports were organized, and a detailed
timetable of the workshops was also uploaded to BPHC ShoutBox. The
Sports Secretary said that one whole day was dedicated to discussing
sports on campus during the Freshmen Orientation 2018. (this point is
slightly similar to the next point, which also talks about workshops)





Workshops: Fulfilled


The Sports Secretary proposed that a "well tabulated calendar" be
made for organizing sports workshops on campus. All the girls’ sports
teams conducted workshops that went on for multiple days and timetable
was devised and was posted on BPHC ShoutBoxx for students on campus to
participate. Link to timetable





Sports in Hostel: In Progress


The Sports Secretary said that the courts in girls' hostels are being
 maintained regularly, as are the inventory for Throwball, Volleyball
and Carrom. Apart from this, the Sports Secretary said that the Table
Tennis tables have been replaced. The only shortcoming in this segment
is the inventory for Table Tennis and Badminton, which couldn't be
replaced over apprehensions that students might misuse them. The
manifesto also talked about indoor sports and activitiessuch as "Martial
 Arts, Self Defence, Yoga, and Zumba", which haven't manifested yet. The
 Sports Secretary said that instructors for these were not factored into
 this semester’s budget and hence this could not be fulfilled.





Coach: Fulfilled


This point on the manifesto proposed for "provision of trained
coaches specifically for girls' sports teams". Almost all the teams
except for badminton have a coach. However, some teams have a coach on
an on-call basis.





Gym: Not Fulfilled


This point proposed the provision of a separate gym for girls on the
ground floor of SAC and "separate [gym] timings on some days of the week
 for girls" along with a female gym instructor. The secretary feels that
 this point is not feasible because the administration wants all the
facilities to be equal among students. As a result, it was decided to
put cardio on the first floor and weight training below because girls
would rather work on cardio. New treadmills are being installed on the
first floor to accommodate for the higher crowd that cardio garners.





Increase Outside Participation: Fulfilled


The sports captains have a calendar of all tournaments and events
coming in the semester. This increased outside participation, with prior
 information, there was good practice. Our teams attended BOSM, MEC,
CBIT, and IITH. We have also seen an increase in medals this semester.
Our teams have earned 14 medals over the course of this semester, which
they usually earn over the duration of a year.





Dietician and Nutritionist: Not Fulfilled


This point proposed a nutritionist to be available in college for
help in setting "diet for sports players". This couldn't happen so far
as this expense wasn't a partof the budget for the first semester. The
Sports Secretary (Girls) also mentioned that women
dieticians/nutritionists aren’t ready to come as far as our campus when
they were reached out.





Cycle Marathons: Not Fulfilled


This manifesto point talked about introducing "monthly cycle
marathons in collaboration with Cykul" which haven't happened yet.  The
Sports Secretary said that the plan to conduct Cycle Marathons was now
replaced with a Duathlon which would be conducted during Arena.
(Duathlon is not a new event this Arena - even Arena 2018 had this event).
 She also mentioned that they would not with be partnering with Cykul as
 they are not in touch with them anymore. Once a deal is worked out
with, she intends to conduct two or three marathons. The manifesto point
 however clearly mentioned "monthly cycle marathons" which have clearly
not happened yet.





Outside the Manifesto:


The Sports Secretary also talked to us about other general issues on compus.



The participation during the Independence Day Run spiked from 40-50 participants to 200+.
SAC Equipment Changes: This year the administration has put in a lot of effort with changing and adding gym equipment.
Red Bull Tournament: The two sports secretaries together helped organise the Futsal and Badminton tournaments in collaboration with RedBull.
Devil’s Circuit Campus Frenzy: This semester Devil’s circuit saw participation from a BITS contingent
Teachers' day matches were held for football, volleyball, tennis and badminton



The Sports Secretary also said that she believes that our sports
teams are improving - BPHC won every single one of the friendly matches
with IITH. The medals earned by our sports teams are increasing
exponentially, as they are encouraged to participate in more tournaments
 and events. The Sports Secretary also mentioned that in the budget for
the next semester, the prize money for events during Arena has been
increased.
