<p>BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus, one of the most prestigious colleges in<br />
 India, keeps proving its distinction from time to time. While getting<br />
better academically, soaring to greater heights of success each year, it<br />
 also brings out its most through its fests - Pearl and ATMOS.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>ATMOS - The Assimilation of Technically Motivated Souls - has been a<br />
display of the college’s thriving technical culture since its<br />
inauguration in 2012.</p>

<p>The very first ATMOS in 2012 was indeed a massive crowd-puller. It<br />
spanned for three days and saw huge participation from all over the<br />
country. Remarkable events such as Robotics and Circuit Design<br />
competition were held and  Headliner events included workshops from<br />
notable companies like Wikipedia and DreamWorks Animation. Ethical<br />
Hacking and Android app development workshops provided an insight into<br />
the modern technical trends.</p>

<p>The National General Quiz, Enigma 2013 was the highlight of ATMOS,<br />
2013. The technical associations organised several competitions. Cannon<br />
Wars by the Association of Chemical Engineers, Open Outcry by the<br />
Economics Association, Junkyard Wars by the Mechanical Engineering<br />
Association garnered several enthusiastic participants. The Computer<br />
Science Association’s events like Algomaniac, Brainstorm and Codename<br />
were also very popular. There was a Raspberry Pi workshop for robotics<br />
enthusiasts and also a Windows 8 Appfest, a coding marathon/heaven for<br />
web developers.</p>

<p>The third edition of ATMOS in 2014 marked a slight deviation in its<br />
theme and organisation to accommodate more events on management and<br />
finance to completely justify its description as a techno-management<br />
festival. New events like Open Outcry, Managers Dilemma and Trading<br />
Brains were met with widespread approval. Usual technical events such as<br />
 RoboWars, CircuitArt and Mini GP continued to engage participants and<br />
Enigma 2014 was again a huge success on a national scale with over 250<br />
teams participating in the regionals. A footfall of 5000 was registered<br />
over the course of the three days of the fest.</p>

<p>2015 saw the most popular edition of ATMOS ever with a footfall of a<br />
whopping 8000 during the three days from 9-11th October. The<br />
inauguration was especially well regarded with mind-blowing performances<br />
 by the Dance and the Dramatics Clubs. Sponsorship saw an all time high<br />
with official sponsors including Coca Cola, Red Bull, Uninor and the<br />
likes. Guests of honour who turned up for the fest included Dr. G.<br />
Satheesh Reddy, technical advisor to the Defence Minister and Director<br />
of DRDO and Justice Markandey Katju, former Chief Justice of India and<br />
Chairman of the Press Council of India. Suit Up, an event organised by<br />
the CEL was one of the most popular events that year. Enigma 2015 finals<br />
 saw renowned quizzer Vikram Joshi take up the role of quizmaster with<br />
the 8 winners of the regional rounds taking part. A grand total of 50k<br />
as prize money was up for grabs during Enigma.</p>

<p>The most recent ATMOS, 2016 had a rather interesting theme -<br />
Illusions, Paradoxes and Perspectives. Much like the fascinating theme,<br />
the inaugural performances by the Music, the Dance, Shades and the<br />
Dramatics Clubs were stupefying! DJ Paroma enlivened and brewed up the<br />
whole campus with her indelible proShow. The BITSMUN 2016, which was<br />
conducted along with ATMOS proved to be a grand success as well. Some of<br />
 the significant workshops included PyBITS, RC Aircraft, Aerial<br />
Photography, IoT and Fastrack Automobile. PyBITS being one of the<br />
highlighted events aimed at promoting the usage of Python among the<br />
attendees, and at introducing them to new ideas as to the applicability<br />
of Python in various programming domains. In addition to already popular<br />
 headliner events, the major competitive events encompassed Code Jam,<br />
Reverse Coding and Algomaniac. Sponsors like Cyient, Prodigy, SBI, Heico<br />
 and KTM funded the fest making it a grand success. A noteworthy guest<br />
oration was delivered by Dr. Devi Shetty, cardiosurgeon, chairman and<br />
founder of Narayana Health, Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri laurel.</p>
