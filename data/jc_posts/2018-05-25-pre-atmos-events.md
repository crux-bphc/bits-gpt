<p>The competitive coding club on campus has always been extra active<br />
with its educative sessions on Web and Android developer workshops and<br />
competitive coding classes. This year, it organized a workshop on<br />
competitive coding, a workshop on Python and also, the Dussehra Hack<br />
conducted with the help of the Mozilla Foundation. It taught the<br />
students on campus to create their own web extension over a single day.<br />
The participants were taught to develop add-ons in teams of four, with<br />
exciting prizes for the most creative teams.</p>
