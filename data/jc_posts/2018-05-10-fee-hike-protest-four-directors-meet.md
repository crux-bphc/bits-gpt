<p>The meeting of the student representatives of the three campuses of<br />
BITS Pilani with the directors of the campus began around 6.30PM on the<br />
9th May, 2018.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The director of BITS Goa began by stating that the directors were<br />
aware of the seriousness with which the students believe of this matter,<br />
 and that the directors of respective campuses have heard the voices of<br />
the students. He said that illness of the Vice Chancellor was an<br />
unforeseen event and that the Vice Chancellor represents BITS as a<br />
university. He went on to say that it is their responsibility to ensure<br />
the VC was in good health and that he was in AIIMS as this meeting was<br />
happening.  Prof. Raghurama went on to say that the Vice Chancellor, as<br />
the executive head was ultimately in-charge of all these issues.<br />
However, in the absence of the VC, Prof. Raghurama stated that the four<br />
directors of BITS Pilani would like to address the issue. After about<br />
twenty minutes of introductory speech, Prof. Raghurama finally let a<br />
student of BITS Goa ask the first question.<a href="https://github.com/journal-club/wiki-data/blob/master/news/general/2018-fee-hike-directors-meet-minutes.md#q-what-are-the-steps-the-directors-have-taken-in-the-last-five-days-of-protest"></a></p>

<h4>Q: What are the steps the directors have taken in the last five days of protest?</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>: Prof. Raghurama said that he met the students<br />
in the auditorium, and that he was in touch with the other directors of<br />
BITS and the VC.</p>

<h4>Q: What is the administrative mechanism to bring about a change in the fee structure?</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>: The fee decisions are a part of the budget. The<br />
 budget for the institution is made for a year, with a long term plan in<br />
 mind. Prof. Raghurama cited the example of Project Lakshya, stating<br />
that feedback had been taken from faculty and stakeholders involved in<br />
various aspects of that project. After a budget is made, it goes to the<br />
finance committee, which looks at the budget and presents it to the<br />
Board of Governors. Once the board approves, it has to be approved by<br />
the general body, after which it becomes “actionable”.</p>

<h4>Q: When will the next Board of Governors meeting be?</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>: They happen once a year. They have authority to<br />
 only approve the budget. The constitution says, “they will meet as<br />
often as required”. Prof. Sundar added that there is a specific process<br />
to be followed to convene a meet of the board, and that anyone cannot<br />
call for a meet. There will be no meet of the board before summer. Any<br />
decisions taken by the board will be informed to the students. The board<br />
 will probably have no meet over the summer, or in the next six months<br />
for that matter.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Q:<br />
 How is the fee hike being justified, considering the inflation rate?<br />
What is the breakup of the 15%, if inflation is not a major factor?</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>:  The 15% hike is not for existing students. For<br />
 the existing students it will be less than that, and you were told<br />
about a maximum possible hike for 15% when you joined. The Government of<br />
 India revises the salaries by adjusting the Dearness Allowance, which<br />
is usually an increase of 8-10% over the last five years. Inflation rate<br />
 is not applicable uniformly across all sectors.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Q:<br />
 The annual report mentions the difference between on campus and<br />
off-campus revenue. Considering factors like declining WILP, and lack of<br />
 funding from DST could not have been forseen in 2010 when the long term<br />
 goal was made, what is being done to increase off-campus revenue to<br />
reduce burden on the students?</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>: The government funding you speak of is not a<br />
part of the institute budget. It definitely helps in building the<br />
infrastructure of our college, but it is not a part of the budget. At<br />
most, the funding from that is used to fund the running expenses of the<br />
funded project labs. Also, WILP is not just a revenue generator for<br />
BITS. WILP is an educational innovation that is unparalleled in terms of<br />
 what it tries to achieve. Prof Sundar also stated that there is no<br />
annual report that says that WILP is not living up to its expectations.<br />
He also said that if there are problems with WILP, he would be<br />
addressing them with his team. Both of these are not the subject of<br />
discussion today.</p>

<h4>Q:<br />
 The professor to student ratio is roughly 1:19 in BITS. IITs and NITs<br />
have a better ratio and so do some other private colleges. Considering<br />
the fact that BITS is focusing on expansion, why isn’t BITS<br />
concentrating on improving the faculty first?</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>: The number isn’t the only thing that matters.<br />
The quality also does. The private colleges you speak of might be taking<br />
 in recently graduated PhD students as Associate Professor and within a<br />
few years promoting them to Professor. We could have done that a long<br />
time ago, had we wanted to. But we don’t, because quality is more<br />
important. Also, the VC and the directors are conducting interviews for<br />
faculty positions - 200+ interviews have been done so far.</p>

<h4>Q:<br />
 While you might be recruiting faculty to solve the problem, student<br />
intake has been increasing, worsening the ratio. Why have resources been<br />
 diverted towards expansion despite lack of faculty?</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>: Numbers are not the only thing that matter. A<br />
few years ago, BITS had a lot of lecturers (without PhDs). Now, we could<br />
 easily recruit more lecturers to improve the ratio, and that is<br />
something we might consider. We are in the process of recruiting more<br />
professors. Also faculty, especially good faculty, when deciding whether<br />
 to join or not look at where the institute will be in ten years - we<br />
need great facilities to attract great talent.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Q:<br />
 With increase in intake, coupled with increase in fees, how can BITS<br />
maintain quality of students? How will BITS maintain its aim of<br />
“affordable, quality education” as stated in the Bulletin?</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>: Increase of intake will obviously lead to a<br />
drop in cutoff. But that doesn’t mean the quality has reduced. If the<br />
fall in cutoff were not proportional to the rise in seats, that may be a<br />
 cause for concern. That is not the case, however. A number doesn’t just<br />
 decide the quality of the student. Furthurmore, you can’t just judge<br />
student quality by the incoming batch -you need to look at the track<br />
record of the graduating batch as well. A combination of these two<br />
factors, perhaps could be used as a measure for quality. Affordability<br />
of fees is person dependent and income dependent.</p>

<h2>Q: How can current students of BITS afford the fee when it’s been compounding multiple times?</h2>

<h4>Q:<br />
 Loans are sanctioned on the basis of fee in first year. When the fee<br />
increases, students end up exhausting the credit that was sanctioned to<br />
them, due to the multiple increases in fee. Also, SBI loans are<br />
collateral free only upto Rs. 20 lakh. How do you plan on tackling this?</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>: These are real problems - many banks are<br />
willing to give loans to students of BITS Pilani students. These are<br />
issues that we can discuss and sort out, after consulting with everyone<br />
involved.</p>
