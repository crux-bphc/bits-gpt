<p><strong>Kamlesh:</strong> Why are you guys so silent? Helu helu, guys speak up, you know my shoulders hurt from carrying all our conversations…. Ahh did you guys leave? Lemme check the tab.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Kamlesh sees 5 messages in the chat box to unmute the tab.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh:</strong> HALLO! Sorry had gmeet on mute since the day of orientation, When did you guys join? How’s the squad been? How much are y’all missing me?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Kamlesh’s abrupt entry into the conversation startles Shreya and Taksh.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shreya:</strong> Firstly, you need to tone down on your Hellos, you are so loud I could hear it without being on the meet, and secondly, too many questions and lastly, I don’t have time for this, Taksh here is guiding me through this LMS stuff, it’s such a pain in the ….</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Taksh:</strong> Attendance can be marked when you click on this tab right over here, see not that hard….&nbsp; Hey Kamlesh, I see you finally unmuted the tab, we got to see 5 unfiltered minutes of you scrolling through reels, and productive use of time as usual.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh:</strong> bro don’t judge me, not my fault my PS is lite (with a shrug and smirk simultaneously)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shreya:</strong> Yeah sure, Ananya has the same station as you, didn’t really sound like a lite station from what she described, I think that’s just you. Also, Taksh the site still hasn’t loaded yet, why is my life so hard….</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Taksh:</strong> Yeah Sometimes… no actually most of the time the site takes a while to load.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh:</strong> well, you guys need to chill, let’s take a break while the site loads and play a game of skribbl, what say?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shreya:</strong> You are the first person to take a break from a break… But yea sure why not, I’ll play a round.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh:</strong> How was it for you guys? The break from getting destroyed in skribbl from the almighty Zaber19.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shreya and Taksh together:</strong> SHUT UP</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shreya: </strong>Oh! finally LMS is done loading, lemme mark my attendance, whew…&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh: </strong>Yeah, go ahead do your lame stuff, just clear your schedule for mid-July, cause I have our Goa trip all planned out then</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Taksh:</strong> You do know that PS goes till 22nd July right?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>While Kamlesh was elaborating his detailed plans for the trip, there was a chime of notification.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shreya:</strong> Ohh god wait for a minute guys, another mail from my PS mentor. Ugh every time he sends a mail it is always more work.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Taksh:</strong> Be glad that you are getting work, I have been mailing my faculty and mentor all week long and they are more lite than Kamlesh was in online semester.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh:</strong> HEY! Don’t attack you know I was going through a breakup, it was a tough phase for me.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Taksh:</strong> So that’s what you are calling your PUBG addiction now?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shreya:</strong> Guys! (in a sad melancholic sound). My PS has been shifted to offline mode now, and I have to report onsite in 3 days.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Taksh:</strong> Wow, so nice! you get firsthand experience of working, I wish it was me.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shreya:</strong> Are you kidding me? It’s the last thing I would want, all I wanted was a little break in the holidays, but now it feels like I have the weight of a company on my shoulders.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh: </strong>Well how bad could it be? Going out would be good for your health ya know</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Taksh:</strong> You don’t say, have you even seen sun in the last week?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh:</strong> Well…. Wait actually I did! just today (with a surprised smile)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Taksh: </strong>Not on screen.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh:</strong> Well then nope I haven’t.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shreya:</strong> Guys come on, I am going through so much here. Also what’s this annoying music you’re listening to Kamlesh?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh:</strong> Music? Oh wait, its my phone I’ve been getting a call…</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Taksh:</strong> Its been playing since 15 mins… you never really fail to surprise me( with a sigh of disapproval)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh:</strong> Oh frick, I have a quiz going on right now…. Bye guys, see you in couple minutes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shreya:</strong> it’s fine, even I am leaving gotta work on my diary submission.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Taksh: </strong>Back to mailing profs it is then, talk to later then guys, bye.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Kamlesh:</strong> Do you want to end the meet or leave?&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Kamlesh proceeds do neither, just mutes the tab and gives his quiz.</em></p>
