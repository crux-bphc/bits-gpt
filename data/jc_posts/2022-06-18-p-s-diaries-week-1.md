Kamlesh: Why are you guys so silent? Helu helu, guys speak up, you know my shoulders hurt from carrying all our conversations…. Ahh did you guys leave? Lemme check the tab.


Kamlesh sees 5 messages in the chat box to unmute the tab.


Kamlesh: HALLO! Sorry had gmeet on mute since the day of orientation, When did you guys join? How’s the squad been? How much are y’all missing me?


Kamlesh’s abrupt entry into the conversation startles Shreya and Taksh.


Shreya: Firstly, you need to tone down on your Hellos, you are so loud I could hear it without being on the meet, and secondly, too many questions and lastly, I don’t have time for this, Taksh here is guiding me through this LMS stuff, it’s such a pain in the ….


Taksh: Attendance can be marked when you click on this tab right over here, see not that hard….&nbsp; Hey Kamlesh, I see you finally unmuted the tab, we got to see 5 unfiltered minutes of you scrolling through reels, and productive use of time as usual.


Kamlesh: bro don’t judge me, not my fault my PS is lite (with a shrug and smirk simultaneously)


Shreya: Yeah sure, Ananya has the same station as you, didn’t really sound like a lite station from what she described, I think that’s just you. Also, Taksh the site still hasn’t loaded yet, why is my life so hard….


Taksh: Yeah Sometimes… no actually most of the time the site takes a while to load.


Kamlesh: well, you guys need to chill, let’s take a break while the site loads and play a game of skribbl, what say?


Shreya: You are the first person to take a break from a break… But yea sure why not, I’ll play a round.&nbsp;


Kamlesh: How was it for you guys? The break from getting destroyed in skribbl from the almighty Zaber19.


Shreya and Taksh together: SHUT UP


Shreya: Oh! finally LMS is done loading, lemme mark my attendance, whew…&nbsp;


Kamlesh: Yeah, go ahead do your lame stuff, just clear your schedule for mid-July, cause I have our Goa trip all planned out then


Taksh: You do know that PS goes till 22nd July right?


While Kamlesh was elaborating his detailed plans for the trip, there was a chime of notification.&nbsp;


Shreya: Ohh god wait for a minute guys, another mail from my PS mentor. Ugh every time he sends a mail it is always more work.


Taksh: Be glad that you are getting work, I have been mailing my faculty and mentor all week long and they are more lite than Kamlesh was in online semester.


Kamlesh: HEY! Don’t attack you know I was going through a breakup, it was a tough phase for me.


Taksh: So that’s what you are calling your PUBG addiction now?


Shreya: Guys! (in a sad melancholic sound). My PS has been shifted to offline mode now, and I have to report onsite in 3 days.


Taksh: Wow, so nice! you get firsthand experience of working, I wish it was me.


Shreya: Are you kidding me? It’s the last thing I would want, all I wanted was a little break in the holidays, but now it feels like I have the weight of a company on my shoulders.


Kamlesh: Well how bad could it be? Going out would be good for your health ya know


Taksh: You don’t say, have you even seen sun in the last week?


Kamlesh: Well…. Wait actually I did! just today (with a surprised smile)


Taksh: Not on screen.


Kamlesh: Well then nope I haven’t.


Shreya: Guys come on, I am going through so much here. Also what’s this annoying music you’re listening to Kamlesh?


Kamlesh: Music? Oh wait, its my phone I’ve been getting a call…


Taksh: Its been playing since 15 mins… you never really fail to surprise me( with a sigh of disapproval)


Kamlesh: Oh frick, I have a quiz going on right now…. Bye guys, see you in couple minutes.


Shreya: it’s fine, even I am leaving gotta work on my diary submission.


Taksh: Back to mailing profs it is then, talk to later then guys, bye.&nbsp;


Kamlesh: Do you want to end the meet or leave?&nbsp;


Kamlesh proceeds do neither, just mutes the tab and gives his quiz.
