<p>The Disciplinary Committee, or DisCo for short, is something which<br />
intrigues most students on campus. For some, coming under the purview of<br />
 it is a nightmare come true, while for others, it is a badge they wear<br />
with pride, something ‘cool’. But strangely, for something so important,<br />
 there exists virtually no information about the process, and its<br />
workings. This article aims to detail all of this as comprehensively as<br />
possible.</p>

<h1>The Committee</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Committee consists of 6 members: the Associate Dean of the<br />
Students Welfare Division (who acts as the convener of the Committee),<br />
the Chief Warden, two teachers and two student representatives. The<br />
student representatives are picked by the Students’ Union Council and<br />
vetted thoroughly by the SWD Associate Dean in terms of their academic<br />
and disciplinary record and other students’ opinion of them, before<br />
being approved by the Senate. In order to maintain gender equality,<br />
there is always one male student and one female student in the<br />
Committee. All members of the Committee have equal say and the majority<br />
decision is enforced.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Committee members receive no payment or benefits for their work<br />
as it is considered part of their usual academic duties. Moreover, it is<br />
 important to note that the Disciplinary Committee only recommends the<br />
course of disciplinary action to be taken. The final decision is taken<br />
by the Administration. This ensures a completely fair process, with no<br />
place for personal issues being a factor in decision making.</p>

<h1>The Procedure</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Any case of indiscipline, or violation of rules is first reported to<br />
the respective Hostel Warden by the Hostel Superintendent. (Note: The<br />
Hostel Wardens are the Professors in-charge of the hostel, while the<br />
superintendents are the ones in the hostel office.)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Hostel Warden then informs the Chief Warden and the Associate<br />
Dean of the SWD who determine the seriousness of the violation. The<br />
student is summoned and questioned with regards to the incident, and<br />
they are given a chance to defend themselves. If the student admits<br />
guilt, then a Committee meeting is convened to determine the further<br />
course of action. On the other hand, if the student insists that they<br />
are innocent, the Superintendents are asked to submit proof of the<br />
student’s guilt. If they fail to provide sufficient proof, the student<br />
is given the benefit of the doubt and let go.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After this step, in case guilt is proved, the Committee convenes to<br />
decide the student’s punishment. There is a set of standard guidelines<br />
laid down by the Administration detailing every offence and the<br />
punishment for the same. For first-time offenders, these guidelines are<br />
usually followed strictly. However, for repeat offenders, stricter<br />
action is taken, depending upon the gravity of the offence and the<br />
general conduct of the concerned student. There are various levels of<br />
punishment, varying from just a warning to fines to suspension for a<br />
semester or a year too, and in extreme cases, expulsion from the<br />
institute.</p>

<h1>The Fine</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A general misconception among most students is that the money<br />
collected as the fine goes to the Administration, which would construe a<br />
 conflict of interest. However, this is not so. The money actually goes<br />
to the Student Aid Fund (SAF) which helps students in need. Hence, all<br />
the money collected through disciplinary action is used for the students<br />
 themselves.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Punishment or Correction?</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The intention of the Disciplinary Committee is not to ruin students’<br />
lives by giving excessively harsh punishments. The aim of the Committee<br />
is to serve as a correctional measure for the students. They believe<br />
that it is not unusual for students at this age to feel the urge to<br />
explore such experiences, and their job is prevent students from going<br />
overboard. Hence, the punishments for first-time offences are usually<br />
fines instead of cancelling registration, as these pinch the students<br />
and teach them a lesson, but do not ruin their future.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, this definitely does not mean that first-time offenders will<br />
 be granted any leniency or be allowed to get away. Moreover, students<br />
who have faced disciplinary action are not allowed to hold any positions<br />
 of responsibility for a year and not allowed to avail institute<br />
scholarships. Hence, one must keep this in mind before getting<br />
themselves into situations that could potentially ruin their future.</p>
