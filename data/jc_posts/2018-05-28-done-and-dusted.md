<p>Arena, the sports fest of BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, is one of<br />
the three main  fests the campus is known across India for, and,<br />
simultaneously, is one of the best, if not the best sports meets in the<br />
entire state of Telengana for students and youth. Arena, brilliantly<br />
named for a sports fest, has continued to up the expectations and set<br />
benchmarks for itself over the years since its inception. It has been<br />
growing and allowing each and every one of its participants grow in<br />
experience and mental strength. Its not the zeal, the organizers, the<br />
students, nor the dedicated contender base that has made Arena one and<br />
only; the place “where legends are born”.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Arena had been born in a campus still young. Back then, in 2013, it<br />
was built from ground up by one Department, along with others like Dopy,<br />
 Dove, Department of Arts and Deco, that was custom made for handling<br />
this, and only this fest. The Firewallz. They made Arena a resounding<br />
success for the first time it was organized. There were hundreds of<br />
participants from across various Institutions, and sports clubs. Since<br />
then, it has grown leaps and bounds to the brand that it is now.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>How much exactly Arena has grown is apparent from the fact that<br />
earlier, turnout used to be in hundreds. Now, its in thousands. Earlier,<br />
 our own grounds and facilities were enough for the participants. Now,<br />
facilities from outside have to be availed. Firewallz booked not one,<br />
but two outside Cricket Grounds for the players. Prize Money has<br />
increased by thousands, encouraging new players to try and win in the<br />
fest tournaments. We have attracted contingents not only from all over<br />
the state, but also all over India. There were 3,500 contenders, while<br />
many more came to watch. Among the players, needless to say, were people<br />
 from colleges from the length and breadth of the country. We had NITs<br />
like NIT Warangal, NIT Trichy, etc, as well as participants from IIT<br />
Madras and IIT Kanpur among other reputed Colleges like JNTU, or Osmania<br />
 University and many more others from throughout India from all major<br />
cities. All this has been possible because of the Nationwide name Arena<br />
has become. Sponsors and participants this year tended to contact us,<br />
before we contacted them so that they can further themselves for being<br />
associated with the name of Arena, and that, in itself is quite<br />
commendable from a campus that is as young as ours.</p>

<p>In Arena 2018, Chief Guest was Mr. Henry Menezes, an ex Goalkeeper<br />
for the Indian football team, currently the CEO of Western Indian<br />
Football Association. Pepsico, an international organization of insanely<br />
 high reputation, was the title sponsor. Other main sponsors included<br />
the Zubi Academy, a Hyderabad based sports academy of National repute,<br />
and the Oval grounds. Oval Grounds sponsored the Cricket grounds booked<br />
outside campus. This year, the official Arena Pro show was by Candice<br />
Redding, who gave an awesome  performance.</p>

<p>Most of all, the people for whom Arena is made of and for, the sports<br />
 commnity of BPHC gave a commendable performance. The sheer dedication,<br />
due to which the athletes and other competitors were seen in any time of<br />
 the day in the field, or in the sports rooms of the SAC, paid off, as<br />
BPHC emerged as the single team with the highest number of collective<br />
medals amongst any other college or association. In chess(Boys),<br />
Tennis(team), Table Tennis(boys and girls) and Football, our campus won<br />
Medals; Chess, Table Tennis team, and Tennis team winnning Gold, and<br />
Table Tennis Girls and Football team winning silver medals.</p>

<p>One of the main attractions for Arena this year was the Inter BITS<br />
tournament. Other than the Pilani contingent not attending, the<br />
tournament was an overall success. Goa and Dubai sent their teams, each<br />
team winning a few medals. Hyderabad, of course, won the highest number<br />
of medals. The Goa contingent was huge, containing over 100 people.</p>

<p>In closing, Arena was a success, as always. New things were tried to<br />
improve the experience. An app was launched and maintained solely by the<br />
 students on campus, in tandem with the website designed by the same<br />
students, which provided live feed and other news to the attending<br />
people. Participation was larger than ever. Organizing Committee became<br />
more organized and vigilant themselves(they were able to secure sports<br />
facilities, grounds with rates almost half of previous rates with their<br />
experience.) The entire event was flawless, with almost no major hiccups<br />
 in sight. Most important of all, the those who attended had nothing but<br />
 nice things to say, that we, as a campus were able to gift them some<br />
beautiful memories and experiences.</p>
