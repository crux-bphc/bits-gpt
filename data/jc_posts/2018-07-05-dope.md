Another of the new additions to the campus, along with SaFL, the Wall
 Street Club, and the Ultimate Frisbee Team. DoPE is one of the newest
departments on campus, and is important because the department is in
charge of pro-shows during fests, which can make or break a fest.


DoPE was formed officially after ATMOS but worked during ATMOS
too.Their inductions process consisted of two rounds, an interview round
 along with a second round in which inductees had to come up with ideas
for pro-shows for a fest. This helped in preparing them for the actual
work lying ahead. This year, so far, DoPE had two sets of inductions for
 the 2017 batch - one before ATMOS, and another series of inductions
after ATMOS, which saw a lot of interest amongst freshers. The results,
however, showed that inductions into DoPE were quite selective, as only
ten students had been inducted in total from the 2017 batch, while more
than a hundred interested students turned up for inductions.


This ATMOS they were able to bring a leading Indian band, The Local
Train, as well Rahul Subramanian, an upcoming comedian to our campus.
For ARENA, the proshow was Candice Redding, which received a mixed
response in campus. However recruiting artists for pro-shows forms only a
 part of their work - it is their responsibility, also, to arrange for
the travel, stay, hospitality and the special needs of the artists. Now
that ATMOS and ARENA are done and dusted, their work for Pearl is cut
out for them. Theyâ€™ve been working at it since November aiming to make
the fest a huge success. The rest of the campus, however, is still in
the dark - who are the artists? Is the contribution we made from our
mess accounts going to give us a better pro-show this year? The answer
to these questions will have to wait, till we find out more!
