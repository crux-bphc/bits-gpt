The month of January began with the delayed appearance of CGPA
causing the added burden of suspense before the infliction of trauma.
This, in addition to the setback with ERP during course registrations,
did not help the students’ sanity. In a fortunate stroke of serendipity,
 Baithak finally made a long-awaited comeback during Lohri. They finally
 had the Freshers’ meet they deserved.


In the latter half of January, BPHC witnessed the latest editions of
Verba Maximus and Arena, our literature and sports fests respectively.
This year’s Verba Maximus was a great success, with Sherlocked receiving
 unprecedented participation. Core Conclave took place on the campus
alongside Arena due to which the Auditorium was unavailable for a few
days. Arena 2018 being Inter-BITS saw fierce competition from the sister
 campuses along with the local colleges. The Republic Day celebrations,
which happened during ARENA, saw the Vice-Chancellor of BITS Pilani as
the Chief Guest.


With the Smart Campus app up and running throughout both VM and
ARENA, along with Finnovate, the burden food stalls can have on one’s
pockets was reduced considerably. January saw the campus becoming
“smarter” than before through the usage of the ARENA Android App to post
 live updates on matches, and the cashless deductions in ANC.


With the start of a new semester, the college was abuzz with
inductions and reinductions of various departments and clubs. Though
many people have already broken their New Year's Resolution, this month
was indeed a nice start to an interesting year.
