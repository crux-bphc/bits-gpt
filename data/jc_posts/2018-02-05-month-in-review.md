<p>The month of January began with the delayed appearance of CGPA<br />
causing the added burden of suspense before the infliction of trauma.<br />
This, in addition to the setback with ERP during course registrations,<br />
did not help the students’ sanity. In a fortunate stroke of serendipity,<br />
 Baithak finally made a long-awaited comeback during Lohri. They finally<br />
 had the Freshers’ meet they deserved.</p>

<p>In the latter half of January, BPHC witnessed the latest editions of<br />
Verba Maximus and Arena, our literature and sports fests respectively.<br />
This year’s Verba Maximus was a great success, with Sherlocked receiving<br />
 unprecedented participation. Core Conclave took place on the campus<br />
alongside Arena due to which the Auditorium was unavailable for a few<br />
days. Arena 2018 being Inter-BITS saw fierce competition from the sister<br />
 campuses along with the local colleges. The Republic Day celebrations,<br />
which happened during ARENA, saw the Vice-Chancellor of BITS Pilani as<br />
the Chief Guest.</p>

<p>With the Smart Campus app up and running throughout both VM and<br />
ARENA, along with Finnovate, the burden food stalls can have on one’s<br />
pockets was reduced considerably. January saw the campus becoming<br />
“smarter” than before through the usage of the ARENA Android App to post<br />
 live updates on matches, and the cashless deductions in ANC.</p>

<p>With the start of a new semester, the college was abuzz with<br />
inductions and reinductions of various departments and clubs. Though<br />
many people have already broken their New Year's Resolution, this month<br />
was indeed a nice start to an interesting year.</p>
