Why Your Vote Matters?



            











So elections are underway. You’ve probably already seen the campaign videos, been exposed to a million “Vote For X” WhatsApp forwards and been coralled into GMeets where you’re told how you should exercise your vote.
You probably already know how you’re going to vote or you’re probably debating between candidates or you’re planning to Random Number Generator your way through the entire election process – either way, you’ve probably asked yourself why you should care in the first place.
In a very BuzzFeed listicle style view – here are 3 reasons why you absolutely must attend the soapbox and then absolutely must vote
The most important reason you should vote though – is because there’s absolutely no reason not to.It’s your only chance to bring accountability to a system that actively shirks it and to bring up important questions to the candidates and the General Body.
And so, in what is a rising senior’s last attempt to increase political awareness on campus – do go out and talk to the candidates, watch the Soapbox, ask difficult questions and then vote for whoever you want (or don’t want) to lead you.
