<p>Bon Voyage is a farewell event for seniors in their third year that's<br />
 funded by their immediate juniors. This year's Bon Voyage is to be held<br />
 on the 22nd of April. It’s an event that has been considered a<br />
tradition of sorts. A tradition that may happen to involve a bit of<br />
unfair transactions. The Recreational Activities Forum, also called RAF,<br />
 organizes Bon Voyage every year. Apart from this, they’re also the ones<br />
 who screen the weekly movies in the auditorium and organize Teachers’<br />
Day Celebrations. They’re not affiliated with the SU and do not involve<br />
themselves with the business of fests.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How does RAF get the money it needs to pull off an event like this?<br />
At the moment, RAF has no external sponsors and is entirely funded by<br />
students. For the current edition of Bon Voyage, RAF is deducting ₹420<br />
from the 2016 batch, summing up to a total of ₹2,72,160. An additional<br />
amount of ₹30,000, the money that was carried over from Teacher’s Day is<br />
 also being used<sup>1</sup>. Every year RAF collects significantly more<br />
 money during Teachers' Day than they need and this ‘surplus’ is<br />
diverted to balance the BV budget. How can we justify taking such a<br />
large amount from students without telling them what they’re paying for?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The deductions for Bon Voyage have increased by <strong>30%</strong> each year from ₹250 in 2016 to ₹325 in 2017 and finally ₹420 this year<sup>2</sup>.<br />
 Following this trend, for the 2018 Batch Bon Voyage, they will have to<br />
pay slightly less than ₹1000. For comparison, ATMOS 2017’s GBM was held<br />
to convince the General Body for a deduction of ₹200 rupees for three<br />
days of <strong>one of the best fests</strong> in the country. Should we really be spending <strong>twice the amount</strong> for what is effectively a single awards ceremony and dinner?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The constitution<sup>3</sup> dictates the necessity of a GBM for any deductions proposed to the general body.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The lack of any official consent of a majority for compulsory<br />
deductions makes the current proceedings wrong, both morally and<br />
legally.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We reached out to RAF to listen to their side of the story. According<br />
 to them, the increased price this year was due to the decreased number<br />
of students in the 2016 batch, who would be footing the bill for this<br />
Bon Voyage. However, they cannot justify the increase in deductions over<br />
 the last two years, as it was organized by a different RAF. RAF claims<br />
that there have never been any issues since its inception, nor was there<br />
 ever a GBM. They also validate the deduction by saying “the paying<br />
batch would be repaid through the next batch and so forth”. The<br />
deductions were approved by the Associate Dean SWD, the CRC and the<br />
President<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the process of celebrating our seniors, have we really made sure<br />
that everyone is comfortable with paying such a significant amount? Why<br />
is it acceptable for the administration to deduct my money without my<br />
consent? This is the third un-consented<sup>5</sup> deduction from students in the past few months. Does the silence of the EC, CRC and SUC indicate that all of this is legal?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Is this a sign of apathy and lenience towards deductions for events<br />
on campus without the approval of the payers? Should this continue?</p>

<p>Footnotes:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><sup>1</sup> The total deduction for Teacher’s Day was ₹71,000 By<br />
tradition, it’s something that has been funded by freshers. Roughly Rs.<br />
30,000 of this amount was left over after the celebration, and this was<br />
carried over to fund other activities. With almost half of this being<br />
sent towards Bon Voyage, is this fair to the freshers some of whom were<br />
allegedly not entirely comfortable with contributing. Why deduct this<br />
much if it’s unnecessary?</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><sup>4</sup> The exact procedure by which the deductions were approved is still unclear.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><sup>5</sup> The other two un-consented deductions were for the two<br />
moonlight dinners organised by the messes. Also, the deductions for<br />
Pearl and ATMOS of of ₹1000 and ₹200 respectively, while passed through<br />
GBMs and is legal, might still be morally un-consented as money is still<br />
 being deducted from people who voted against/didn't agree to the<br />
motion.</p>
