<p><strong>How did you feel when you first saw the Campus?</strong><br />
I am a person who likes to explore, academically that is. So, my first<br />
thought was that I wanted to be the director of this campus someday. It<br />
felt like a world of possibilities. It was a great feeling.</p>

<p><strong>What kept you motivated across the years in accomplishing such a high CGPA?</strong><br />
I guess motivation is the wrong kind of thing to ascribe something to.<br />
Because, there was a phase when I was bothered by my performance. In the<br />
 first year I happened to be one of those who performed well. We all<br />
come from the best of our schools and colleges. And it’s very<br />
competitive here. So, first year, I think was a little hard work and a<br />
lot of luck. But what really kept me going after that was that I loved<br />
my subjects. I want to do research and I will pursue a PhD. I chose most<br />
 of the subjects I had, I took MSc Maths by choice and then BE. Computer<br />
 Science too. It was never that I got this, I took this. My motivation<br />
is very simple: I love what I study.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing that you are proud of?</strong><br />
It’s a little sad but I think this is the wildest thing I have done. My<br />
Algebra 2 Compre paper was scheduled for two hours and I finished the<br />
paper quite early. But I was very hungry as I had studied the whole<br />
night. So, that day I didn’t have the strength to pull through and check<br />
 my paper. I got out of the hall, went to the cafeteria below, had some<br />
Masala Dosas and a milkshake. Came back to the hall, checked the paper,<br />
pointed out a couple of mistakes in the question paper, had a nice chat<br />
with the instructor and left. In all seriousness, though, the proudest<br />
things would be my relations here. I have met some of the nicest people<br />
on the planet here. I think, that is something that I will carry with<br />
me.</p>

<p><strong>And one thing that you regret?</strong><br />
Well, I wish I had auditioned for drama club. I am the sort of a person<br />
who is involved in very rigid, procedural things, be it academics or<br />
extracurricular activities. I would have liked to do something that<br />
involved some more physical expression. I was very famously known for<br />
not even swinging an arm at the DJ nights. I think that I should have<br />
loosened up a bit.</p>

<p><strong>How do you see the Campus progressing<br />
in the near future?</strong><br />
Students are absolutely getting brighter every year and the campus is<br />
growing in a lot of aspects. BITS produces great businessmen and<br />
technocrats. And a lot of work is going on with respect to start-ups,<br />
competitive coding, internships, etc. But I don’t see BITS growing in<br />
research any time soon and that’s something I would like our institute<br />
to progress in.</p>

<p><strong>In a sentence, how would you describe<br />
your experience here?</strong><br />
It has been a one hell of a ride. The person I am today, the kind of<br />
opportunities I have got, the kind of people I have met, I owe it all to<br />
 this place and I wouldn’t change a thing.</p>

<p><strong>Any message for your juniors?</strong> Stay in school. Don’t do drugs? Follow your dreams. I think it’s the  most cliched thing to say. But, I’d say follow the clichés, there is a  reason they work.</p>
