<p><strong>What clubs and departments have you worked with so far?</strong>&nbsp;I was the Joint Secretary for the Dramatics Club for this year and the Athletics Captain and the Football Vice-Captain. Other than that I was a part of TedX OC, Pearl OC, Verba Maximus '17 and '18 OC, BITSMUN OC and part of the ACE Editorial Board.</p>

<p><strong>How do you think these credentials would help you if you become the sports sec?</strong>&nbsp;For VM, TEDx and Pearl OC, I was part of the logistics so I had a lot of interaction with students from different departments. This has given me a lot of exposure as to how to arrange for various needs and now I have a clear picture of how a fest runs. In addition, being the Joint Secretary of a performing club taught me a lot about performing, leadership and time management. Also, being the Athletics Captain, I saw a lot of potential in the sports arena for girls who probably never thought of trying out a sport. The sporting culture in general has seen a lot of enhancement especially among girls in the past year, but still needs a lot of work. We started a football team from scratch, and had 4 teams participating in Arena. We had a team of 16 people from a group of people out of which only a few had any sporting history, so I think that has been a great learning experience for me.</p>

<p><strong>You said that the culture for sports among girls is not that great. How do you plan on improving that?</strong>&nbsp;A lot of people brought up great new ideas like starting the girls' football team. I want to work on implementing these and go through the process with the team right from its inception, so that the team can focus on the game and the rest is taken care of for them. The worksho avoid should be well planned so as to maximise particiation and avoid clashes. There is a lot of scope for girls' sports and we can harvest this potential with the right resources and a smooth process.</p>
