<p>Undoubtedly the new version of you has decided to be fitter this<br />
2018. January always sees a heavy influx of people in the gym. It is no<br />
secret that a lot of these people break their resolution in the first<br />
month itself. The reason for this lack of motivation to continue is<br />
mainly the excuses they make to convince themselves not to go. The only<br />
way to get past this is to immediately squash whatever excuse you have.<br />
The very thought of leading a healthy lifestyle may seem daunting and<br />
difficult, thatâ€™s why we are here to help keep that resolution of yours.</p>

<p>Firstly get enough sleep, ideally seven hours. This may seem to be<br />
the most basic of all suggestions but there is a reason it is told so<br />
many times. The reason is that things like sleep deprivation, low blood<br />
sugar lead to low willpower which leads to giving into those dangerous<br />
cravings.</p>

<p>Secondly, eat healthily. That means no more loaded fries at Yummpys,<br />
pizzas at Bits n Bytes and volcanoes at Chai Coffee Company.</p>

<p>Thirdly, possibly the important of all the suggestions would be to<br />
avoid stress. This may seem hard keeping in mind all of the things<br />
happening on campus. It could your cumulative grade point average or it<br />
could be that you are overthinking the outcomes of every situation<br />
possible. Mental peace is of paramount importance and staying mentally<br />
fit is just as important as being physically fit. This mental fitness<br />
can be achieved by regularly practicing Yoga and Meditation. The basic<br />
plan that every person who is going to start meditating would be to<br />
start doing it everyday right in the morning after waking up for a<br />
minimum of 15 minutes. All of this may seem difficult but staying<br />
healthy requires effort and sacrifice.</p>
