April is already here, and all of us are restlessly tapping our feet and homes, ready to pack up again at a moment’s notice. This eerie silence and the confusion about the various decisions that the administration might take, however, does not stop us from reminiscing about our campus life. So, here we look back at the various events during March.


International Conference on Drug Discovery (ICDD) 2020 (29th February- 2nd March)


As the threat of COVID-19 looms large in the world, the entire human population is in desperate need of a vaccine to combat the alarming spread of the virus. In dark times such as these, the necessity and the importance of the discovery of new drugs cannot be overstated. BITS Pilani Hyderabad campus, in association with Schrodinger Inc., had the pleasure of hosting the International Conference on Drug Discovery -2020 from 29th February to 2nd March.&nbsp;


The conference was abuzz with enthusiasm and eagerness of the 500+ attendees of the conference. More than 40 scientists from global pharmaceutical R&amp;D companies as well as those from academic backgrounds were flown in to discuss recent advances in drug design and discovery. The conference provided a unique opportunity for students and researchers to personally interact with various eminent scientists, from around the world.&nbsp;


In addition to the informative speeches, there were intense panel discussions, allowing a diverse and multi-opinionated take on several hot topics in the pharmaceutical world. To provide a grand stage to eager budding scientists, a poster competition was also organized. This allowed participants to present the conclusions they had made based on their hypotheses and following research.&nbsp;


The arduous task of drug discovery has only been prioritized by current affairs. But conferences such as this one, aimed towards educating young minds and inspiring research are certainly a step in the right direction.


Mid-semester Examinations (1st March - 8th March)


The onset of midsem week is a time of realisation for many, that half the semester is almost over in the blink of an eye and it is a pretty stressful time for everyone on our campus, be it for the students, professors, or anyone else. Being the second semester, everyone was ready to pull their socks up, usually in order to make up for their first semester grades. And with batchsnaps, Pearl and elections drawing nearer, many banked on this as their chance to secure their grades for the semester. However, with academic stress, another concern tagged along. With the first COVID-19 case in Hyderabad arising around the time of midsems, it was another cause of worry for the students and administration as well. The administration took precautions such as providing hand sanitizer in the messes and getting the mess workers to wear masks. However, this did not quell fears completely. Some students even mentioned that they couldn’t focus on their studies due to the virus outbreak. All in all, it was a stressful week, both in terms of academics and general well-being.&nbsp;


Holi (10th March)


Holi on campus is something that everyone looks forward to, especially this year as it took place right after a stressful week of exams. Sangam organised the Holika Dahan on the eve of Holi where everyone gathered to witness the pyre. On the day of the festival, celebrations took place in front of Stage 2. Water tankers were brought in. Colours along with welcome drinks were also served. It was a fun time, with upbeat music playing as everyone splashed each other in water, colours, tomatoes, eggs and mud! After an exhausting morning, people were not disappointed when they walked into the mess for food. A special lunch was organised with drinks to beat the afternoon heat. Overall, Holi on campus was a blast where people enjoyed themselves to their fullest.&nbsp;&nbsp;


GBM on the Cancellation of Pearl (11th March)


A General Body Meeting was conducted on the 11th of March, having the ‘Discussion and Voting on the Cancellation of Pearl 2020’ as its principal agenda. However, voting was not a referendum. With 494 people being in favour of having an "In-House Pearl" and around 60 each for cancelling Pearl completely or postponing it, the administration has not agreed to have an In-House Pearl and has decided to wait until March 31st to take its final decision about the fest. The deductions of 550 were not processed.


However, the college shut down now has completely fogged the question of Pearl'20, as there is no solid information about the reopening of the campus.&nbsp;


Coding Events


Microsoft Codess and Uber-She++ by UBER were the two coding events that happened this month. Microsoft Codess gave an opportunity to all the 2nd year and 3rd year (Dualites) females, to become a part of the female coders' committee and get the guidance of Microsoft professionals. UBER, on the other hand, as a part of their International Women's Week celebrations, allowed 2nd-year females who cleared the test to visit the Uber India Engineering office in Bangalore. Both processes involved online tests based on the applicant’s knowledge of computer programming, with Uber-She++ having a coding section as well. Around 25 students made it through Microsoft Codess and three girls have cleared the Uber-She++.&nbsp;


Unfortunately, this month’s activities were cut short, with the administration halting all First degree and Higher degree classes, labs etc. within the three Indian campuses as of 14th March and evacuating all the students from the campuses by the 17th of March due to the spread of the COVID-19. As of now, the closure has been extended to April 14th, and the administration has not officially decided on a future plan as of yet.
