<p>From multiple nations bargaining for a coveted chance to host the<br />
Olympics, to scandals involving selections in National and State sports<br />
teams, politics and sports have always been intertwined in ways more<br />
than one. For a large part of Indians, the tone of India-Pak relations<br />
is set by the outcome of a cricket match and a person cheering a<br />
Pakistani victory is declared an anti-national. People believe that<br />
sporting at the highest levels of India, is not clean - and that's<br />
probably not an unjustified opinion considering multiple allegations of<br />
match-fixing, gambling in cricket influencing the matches, and the<br />
ever-opaque BCCI.</p>

<p>Tournaments, which are supposed to be a celebration of sportsman<br />
spirit and sports themselves, quickly turn ugly due to nationalism and<br />
politics having a say. Such pettiness is quite prominent among Indians,<br />
but quite less so among their other Asian counterparts.</p>

<p>Indians have been infamous for their overt displays of violent<br />
nationalism during cricket matches. Somehow, the amount of solidarity<br />
and love for the country seems to hit the roof during such matches...<br />
but the public is not to blame. It's the politicians who have deeply<br />
instilled the policy of divide and rule, due to which Indians have<br />
started alienating other nations. Something clearly needs to change.</p>
