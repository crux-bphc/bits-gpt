<p><strong>Where and which programme have you been offered?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Masters of Science in Analytics at Georgia Tech, Atlanta. It is an interdisciplinary analytics and data science program.</p>

<p><strong>What made you choose this particular field?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I had always been interested in the field of data science. Eventually, I developed further interest in machine learning. To make a career out of it, I planned on going for higher studies and hence this programme seemed to be the most relevant.Â </p>

<p><strong>Can you elaborate on the importance of CGPA and projects for pursuing masters?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Projects are mostly to give you hands-on experience on the kind of studies you want to work on. CGPA is one of the most important elements to be considered while applying for Masters. It is one of the initial screening factors. A lot of colleges have a cutoff and hence to be on the safe side, it is important that one gives adequate attention to their grades.</p>

<p><strong>Other than grades, what should someone focus on in order to find their interests?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Trying out different courses is a good way to find what you find. There are a lot of electives available in our curriculum which can give us a fair idea or at least leads on what we want to do and the flexibility to take up any of those courses is something you should definitely take advantage of. In case you find credits or any other hassle, there are a lot of sources available online which can pave a path for you. You can also try out the online courses offered by different universities to shortlist what you might be interested in. other than this, both the PS should be utilized to attain practical experience in the field.</p>

<p><strong>How have projects which you did in college helped you in building your profile?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I did not do any formal project under a professor in college. However, there were a lot of projects which I worked on as a part of in-course evaluation components. Some of these courses were Information Retrieval, Data Mining and Machine Learning.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any suggestions for the juniors who are still confused on whether they should do MS or focus on placements?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is a very personal choice. Broadly, after graduation one has two choices, either to start working or learn more and go deeper into the field of interest and explore various opportunities. One needs to decide over the course of time what their priority is and then opt for it. Another popular choice is to work for a year or two and then go for masters. It gives you a fair idea if you want to continue working or want to learn more.</p>

<p><strong>What would you suggest to your juniors who are interested in core but still ambivalent about pursuing a career in it?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Personally, I'd say interest trumps other factors because it will be the foundation of your career. Interest in a field is what will drive you to excel in it. If you're interested in core, don't be afraid to pursue it.</p>

<p><strong>Can you mention the importance of Letters of Recommendation for your admit?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Every program requires 2 academic and 1 other LoR. it should be kept in mind that the letters come from a good authority and should be written honestly. The more it describes your work ethics and recommends you highly, the better it is. Although it is not a deciding factor, so I can't put a number on how important they are apart from a formal requirement.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any advice for juniors, related or not to academics?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Things have a way of working out eventually. Stressing about the future and career is not taking you anywhere. Keep your calm and keep your head down and focus on your work.</p>
