<p>A discord server was created with each club having a channel being handled by the respective club POR’s. The server acted as a platform for students to clarify their queries, connect with people of similar interests and receive updates on any workshops being conducted.</p>

<p>The Cultural Secretary wished for the revival of ‘Renaissance’ in the form of an intra-campus cultural competition. She hoped to boost morale and participation by reviving the Bitsian tradition. Unfortunately, Renaissance was not held for the 2020 or 2021 batch due to covid restrictions throughout and the cultural senate being occupied with Orbe Novo otherwise.</p>

<p>The development of soft skills was a significant point in the Cultural Secretary’s manifesto. She has emphasized the importance of these skills and proposed participation in external debates, elocution, essays, and dance/music competitions. Although public platforms and cultural events by embassies were mentioned, no tangible steps could have been taken to promote these events with covid restrictions in place in most colleges and universities.&nbsp;However, a database with contacts of all institutions that could possibly participate when it is conducted considering the situation has improved.</p>

<p>Sanskriti is a night to enjoy the diverse culture, traditions, and talents of the students at BPHC, a point emphasized by the Cultural Secretary as she tries to revive this beautiful event. Covid and online classes made a full-fledged Sanskriti night near impossible and although efforts were made, they went in vain.</p>
