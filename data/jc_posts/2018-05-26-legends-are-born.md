<p>No seriously, if by no other means than excessive fake injuries<br />
footballers are prone too. With Arena right around the corner, every<br />
athlete is putting in everything into training. This is especially true<br />
for all those whose new year resolution was to wake up early and go for a<br />
 jog and fortunately are holding out a bit longer than those who<br />
resolved to attend the morning lectures.</p>

<p>Teams from across the country will be participating in the potpourri<br />
of sports with more zeal than we ever showed for our academics or<br />
perhaps ever will. We owe this fervour to origins of these sports where<br />
games were indeed a matter of life and death; some more than others.<br />
Colonialism and the world wars are the main reasons why our favourite<br />
sports are common these days. We can take this even further for our<br />
glorified national sport of hockey, which goes as far back as 1400BCE<br />
where they play hockey with skulls and the losing team was usually<br />
sacrificed to gods so that the sun kept moving. Thankfully nowadays a<br />
hockey game is slightly less serious.</p>

<p>Speaking of serious sports, racquet sports are the way the cookie<br />
crumbles. A tennis match is played like a war usually. John Isner and<br />
Nicholas Mahut (The 70-68 Wimbledon match) played 183 games over three<br />
days which is just insanity. Incidentally, the longest recorded tennis<br />
rally took 29 minutes in a 1984 women’s match. Of course, that doesn’t<br />
imply anything. Not really, it’s amazing that we now have women’s<br />
football and basketball teams because when our semester started they<br />
would only advertise the frisbee team to the girls.</p>
