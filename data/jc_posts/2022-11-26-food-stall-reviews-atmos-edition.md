<p>There are fewer finer joys than a warm chocolatey waffle after a cold day of standing in line waiting for coupons/wristbands/comedy shows (pick your poison, really). You can't really go wrong with waffles drenched in chocolate. Although the menu seems like it holds a variety, everything on the menu more or less tastes the same with it being a sugar overload. If you're someone with a strong sweet tooth, you'll like this place, but if not, stay away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As every fest comes along, there is always that one food stall that looks flashy, feels flashy and eats flashy - but invariably leaves you wondering over how better your "fake SWD" money could have been spent on literally any other stall - especially on that one thing your friend says is super good. Papichulo takes the mantle of that stall this fest. To borrow a word - it's at best "mid". Very pricy for what's basically a tepid hot dog with a lot of mayo on it.</p>

<p>Just spend your money elsewhere, and you'll be happier.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As usual, this stall outdoes itself by serving scrumptious dosas at affordable prices, putting the rest of the stalls to shame. Try literally any variety of dosa, and you won’t be disappointed with the quality and quantity served.</p>

<p>It offers a plethora of toppings and dressings garnished on fries in a 180-200 price range. They are served crispy hot with tantalizing options such as garlicky cheese fries and they have got something for the non vegetarians too which we found to be soggy. It's a great dish to share with your friends, though you would be rather hungry afterwards.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Serving chicken dum biryani at 200 bucks, with a dearth of chicken pieces, it’s a decent stall to pay a visit to fulfill your hungry soul. They sell veg biryani at a cheaper price of 150 so rejoice vegetarians. The taste is either a hit or miss and Vijay Vahini biryani fans would be disappointed with the quantity and price range.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Selling varied flavours of lime soda either at Rs. 50 or 100, it sure helps beat the afternoon heat after waiting in the line for coupons for hours. The adventurous person in you can try the black currant soda. Or if you’re feeling meek you can stick to the sweet and salt.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>La Pinoz is one of the few stalls that is immediately recognisable for most people, however the stall fails to live up to its brand name. The amount of food you get for what you pay is disappointing, and the selection is mediocre too. Had their items been half the price, they would have been worth a purchase, however as such they provide a very average product for an exorbitant price, especially when there's many better stalls to try out.</p>

<p>It's Subway. It's literally Subway. You can't really go wrong with this stall.&nbsp; Although they have a rather limited menu, you still get the fresh veggies and in-house bread that Subway is known for. And of course this stall is sure to bleed your wallet.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This fancy ice cream stall serves flavours which are sure to bring out the elasi in you. There have been no complaints tastewise, with classics like cold coffee sure to lure you into spending a minimum of Rs. 100. You can ditch the cone at this place, with some finding it distracting from the soft creaminess of the ice cream.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This place deals with your beverage needs, selling everything from coffees to thickshakes, and even iced teas and mocktails. While the prices are quite high, some had the pleasure of trying out a Thickshake, which wasn't so 'thick' after all. The flavour was quite good, but we’ll say that it wasn't worth the money.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Remember that humble,&nbsp; cheap chaat stall next to bitsian pleasant and that shawarma place? It’s now rebranded itself into a more expensive food stall serving up hot chole bhature and khulche. Again, tastes good but do you really want to spend more through swd money if you can have it at a good deal on any other day?</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This food stall serves delectable kathi rolls at a price of 120. People have complained about the quantity served but the taste makes up for the scarce chicken pieces. So if you’re one to dig on rolls, be sure to give this stall a visit.</p>

<p>The bitsian pleasant’s shawarma stall disguised as a more expensive stall, it’s pretty decent but again there doesn’t seem to be anything special about the shawarma considering the price. Again, visit the stall if you’re in a mood to fill yourself up.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Serving steamed, fried and momos in broth accompanied by schwezan sauce and mayo to balance it out, it’s a pretty good stall. Definitely try the steamed ones, and probably skip over the fried option as some found it to be too greasy. Around the 100 rupee range, it’s not too pricy.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Equipped with a menu that would satisfy a chicken lover's palette, fireblaze bbq was one of our favourites. The bbq sauce coated wings and nuggets were the highlight of the menu. Burgers were decently good, ranging from fried chicken fillings (the zinger burger) to fish patty. Burgers from this stall are comparatively more expensive than the other stall offering burgers, by a slight amount.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yes, the name of the stall was written in Telugu and I had to have it translated for me. Anyway, there seems to be a clear divide with the general populace with some finding it to be the perfect refreshment drink and a few finding it to be rather artificial tasting. Not reliable in taste, but do we really care if it quenches our thirst?</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They serve everything fried potato and frankies at a fixed cost of 100. With spiral potatoes to peri peri fries, and the usual franky options, this stall isn’t too heavy on the pocket. The fries and the spirals are pretty crispy, so do visit this stall if you want to munch on something.</p>

<p>It serves one thing and one thing only. A chocolate and vanilla softy priced at 50. And it does a pretty decent job of cooling your senses after a tiring day of doing menial jobs for departments.</p>

<p>The cooking club rises from its dormancy during fests and serves up fan favourites like fries to basic burgers. They’ve also got orange paneer, their version of the orange chicken. And if you have a sweet tooth don’t forget about the iced tea and pancakes.</p>

<p>With no name to this stall and right at the centre of chaos, you literally can’t miss this stall. Serving badam doodh and jalebis at 70 each, it’s pretty decent. If you wanna feel better about your expenses, this stall would fit the bill.</p>
