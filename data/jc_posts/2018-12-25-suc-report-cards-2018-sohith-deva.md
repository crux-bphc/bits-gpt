<h1>Sports Organizing Committee (SOC): Fulfilled</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A committee consisting of one representative from each sports team<br />
has been created to organize intra college fests such as Rixa and<br />
Blitzkrieg. As a result of the formation of this committee, the burden<br />
of conducting intra college fests has been removed from the team<br />
captains who now have more time to focus on their teams. The SOC managed<br />
 to conduct 7 events this year when compared to 2 events last year in<br />
Rixa. They also handled the logistics for the sports contingents who<br />
participated in colleges outside.</p>

out that a skating rink is being made in the present location of the<br />
Infinity Pool. A CS:GO Event was conducted. For Kho-Kho the ground is<br />
currently being levelled which will soon be started as an informal<br />
sport. Considering that the equipment for Archery is expensive, the<br />
Secretary hopes to take advantage of the campaign for Archery in South<br />
India and said that he has also spoken to the Secunderabad Club<br />
regarding this.</p>

<p>This point promised for “a method for providing regular feedback”<br />
will be implemented and that “updates to the sports inventory will be<br />
made on a regular basis”. The point also went on to promise the<br />
availability of coaches for all sports and “maintenance and proper<br />
management of grounds”. While most sports now have coaches, some sports<br />
like Carrom and Squashdo do not. For every team, 8 coaching sessions<br />
have been arranged before Arena and a couple more during the semester.<br />
The Sports Secretary also said that a record is maintained at SAC to<br />
keep track of the inventory relating to every sport and that the grounds<br />
 are also being maintained on a regular basis. This year, the Basketball<br />
 and Tennis courts are also being repaved, an initiative by the<br />
administration.</p>

He also mentioned that Free Medical kits would be distributed to team<br />
captains during Arena, and that an MoU with Biological E Ltd has already<br />
 been signed for the same.</p>
