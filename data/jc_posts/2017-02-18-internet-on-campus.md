<p>At BPHC, it is possible for us to live without food for a day, but<br />
not without internet, even for an hour. From Facebook and<br />
club/department work to accessing academic and professional resources,<br />
our lives on campus depend heavily on the internet. It being so crucial<br />
to everything we do, any disruption in the net service or speed is bound<br />
 to cause an uproar and rightly so. Though complaints about the net<br />
speed have reduced greatly (particularly after the forming of the IPC<br />
Student Nucleus), JC Spotlight intended to cover the campus internet<br />
scenario so that all students know of all possible perspectives about<br />
it. This was done so that the students could take an informed and mature<br />
 course of action if some problem arises in future.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It was 2014. Modi had just been elected Prime Minister. Those were<br />
the times when half of the present campus crowd was studying for their<br />
entrance exams. The campus internet speeds were agreeable to everyone.<br />
Net wasn’t as good as one would have access to at home. Yet, it was<br />
agreeable. Those who wanted large file downloads used to do it early in<br />
mornings. Problems in speed started in second semester of 2014-15. A few<br />
 discussions ensued in FEG and it ended there. In the first semester of<br />
2015-16, however, the speed fell to new lows. Everyone on campus mailed<br />
the IPC office at least once, leading to IPC, in consultation with<br />
Student Representatives (nominated by the then Student Union),<br />
introducing a data cap of 800 MB per student per day. The idea behind<br />
the introduction of the cap was to ensure that a minority of users don’t<br />
 eat up most of the bandwidth. Following an uproar on FEG and Shoutboxx,<br />
 however, the cap was removed. Rather, an 800 MB per download cap was<br />
introduced. Slow net still ensued though. In February 2016, a new<br />
internet policy was adopted, with a 2 GB data cap per person per day.<br />
Since the cap was within the acceptable range of most, it wasn’t<br />
contested.</p>

<h1>Current Scenario</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The campus has a total of 490 Mbps bandwidth. Of this, 90 Mbps is<br />
allocated to ACAD Block and the remaining is used by the rest of the<br />
campus. As of the date of publication of this piece, no bhavan-wise<br />
individual allocation was in place. The data cap is 2 GB per user per<br />
day. From 5 days before the major examinations (T1, T2 and Compre), the<br />
cap is raised to 5 GB per day.</p>

<h3>What changed between 2014 and now?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Honestly, we couldn’t come to a conclusion as to what really changed.<br />
 The average daily consumption of the whole campus for the month of<br />
September 2016 was 2500 GB per day. It means that not everyone exhausts<br />
their data cap. Yet, one of the many possible ways of explaining the<br />
difference between 2014 and now could be that, given we are growing<br />
technically and culturally by the semester, our data needs have been<br />
increasing at a rate faster than the rate at which bandwidth was being<br />
added. We don’t have consumption data of 2014 to test this hypothesis<br />
though. There could be other reasons too.</p>

<h3>The Cost Factor</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Getting extra bandwidth at our campus is quite different from getting<br />
 it at our homes. In the urban and suburban parts of the city, the<br />
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will have a dense network of optic<br />
fibres. Therefore, if we take a new connection, all he will have to do<br />
is add a small extension from the optic fibre from the road to our<br />
bedroom. But when new bandwidth is added at our campus given all the<br />
existing optic fibres are in full use, it costs a lot more because the<br />
line has to be laid from campus to the nearest beam line (which is<br />
kilometers away).</p>

<h3>Bandwidth vs. Latency</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In reality, bandwidth (though important) is not the only factor that<br />
determines the speed of the net. Another significant factor affecting<br />
speed is Latency. Latency is the delay in response of the website.<br />
Here’s a crude analogy. 100 persons are to start at main gate and get<br />
into F108 as soon as possible. Two factors determine the rate at which<br />
they will enter F108. One, the speed at which they can run. Two, even if<br />
 everyone runs at their peak speed and reach the door at the same time,<br />
they will have to queue up to get in. And this queue length depends on<br />
the width of the door. Here, the time it takes to reach the door is<br />
equivalent to latency. And the width of the door is equivalent to the<br />
bandwidth. Therefore, only high bandwidth may not always ensure speed.<br />
The latency (time lag) should also be low. And this latency varies from<br />
one website to another and depends on varied hardware factors like your<br />
laptop, the website servers, the router etc.</p>

<h3>Then why the Data Cap?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to Aditya Krishna (2014 batch), student representative (who<br />
 was nominated by the then SU, not to be confused with IPC Nucleus), the<br />
 2 GB figure was arbitrary. It wasn’t based on the data consumption<br />
statistics or optimization of data consumption. Rather, a blunt attempt<br />
to enforce a cap. The only rationale for the cap was a conviction that a<br />
 minority of users eat into the bandwidth.</p>

<h3>Cyberoam and Load Balancers</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Many a times, it has been suggested that there could be a bad<br />
configuration of the Cyberoam. According to Aditya Krishna, when he<br />
talked about this to the IPC faculty, “he [said] that hiring people for<br />
the amount they are hired here, this is probably the best level of<br />
expertise you can expect here.”</p>

<h3>The National Knowledge Network</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The NKN is a government-run multi-gigabit network which specifically<br />
serves the educational and research institutions of the country.<br />
BITS-Pilani, as a university, is included in this network and gets a<br />
bandwidth of 10 Gbps. Of this, 150 Mbps is allocated to internet use and<br />
 the remaining for resources like NPTEL. Sreekar Chigurupati (2014<br />
batch) contacted Prof. Chittaranjan Hota in regard to this in 2015.<br />
According to Prof. Hota, because of some architectural issues, the NKN<br />
line cannot be shared with the Hyderabad campus. And BPHC cannot request<br />
 for a separate line for itself as we are not a separate university from<br />
 BITS-Pilani.</p>

<h3>Going the Ethernet way</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A good part of our daily consumption is Facebook. And it’s primarily<br />
used to communicate with people within the campus. Yet, the data has to<br />
go all the way to Fb servers and come back. Something similar happens<br />
with downloads (though not in large scale, thanks to DC). A Linux<br />
Repository has been created on our campus’ servers (Courtesy: Siddhanth<br />
Kumar Patel and Srimanta Barua) so that multiple people need not<br />
download the same update from net and waste their data. An initiative<br />
was taken in the year 2015 by Nischay Mamidi and Rohitt Vashishtha (both<br />
 2015 batch) to make FEG and Shoutboxx posts accessible through<br />
Ethernet, so that multiple persons needn’t load these groups. However,<br />
it didn’t click. According to the current Internet Policy, Facebook,<br />
Gmail, YouTube, and Wikipedia are given partiality for the speed.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The internet speed is satisfactory now, especially after the<br />
constitution of student representation in form of the IPC Student<br />
Nucleus. Some volatility is observed now and then, but given the number<br />
of users, that is expected. JC Spotlight nevertheless covered this issue<br />
 for the sake that you get a presentation of all the discussions and<br />
perspectives on it and in case of any issue in the future, you have most<br />
 of the facts at your disposal.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Some changes are still in requirement for optimal internet usage.<br />
These include making use of intranet instead of internet wherever<br />
possible and statistics based data cap. And the work is hopefully in<br />
progress. The principle problem till last semester, according to<br />
Saivivek Peddi (IPC Nucleus), was that IPC couldn’t understand the<br />
student requirements. Given the Student nucleus, dialogue with IPC is<br />
easier now.</p>
