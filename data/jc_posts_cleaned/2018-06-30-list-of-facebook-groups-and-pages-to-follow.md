GROUPS:



BPHC ShoutBox: This is the official platform for all campus, club/department notices. This includes announcements related to courses by the faculty as well. It's basically a formal platform where all BITSians, students and staff, are present.
BPHC Free Expression Group: A more informal group, this was created to help fellow BITSians for everything under the sun. This is an informal group where you can post your queries and even share your experiences if you think it can help others.
Stronger DC for BPHC: Posts about DC++ on campus. File requests and news about latest uploads is posted here.
Travel @ BPHC: A more approporiate name would be CabSharing@BPHC. Post your time, mode and place and in most cases you will be lucky enough to find people to share a cab with.
BPHC Lost and Found: The most important group in a BITsian’s college life. Lost something? Post it on the group and hope somebody replies. The best part is when you've found something - rest assured, free treats will be on their way!
SMC @ BPHC: All queries regarding food in campus are answered here, be it mess food or the food outlets. The Student Mess Council (SMC) tries it's best to answer your queries over here.
BITSians for Each Other: An entry into the amazing network of BITS Alumni. All BITSians are on this group which can open many opportunities. Sort out your queries with their experience though this portal.
books_BPHC: A group to sell used stuff. Despite the name 'books_BPHC', it's mostly used to sell stuff other than books too. Another group to sell stuff on is buy&amp;sell@bphc, which is a newer group and has lesser members than books_bphc.
Dardanaak BITSians: This group is dedicated to the most active and happening trend on campus: Memes! Post and share all your memes here but be sure to read the rules in the pinned post.
BITS - Music Recommendations: Bored of old mainstream playlists and want something fresh? This is the place for you as it is where people come to discover and share new artists.
PETS@BPHC: Well, the story as to why this group exists is pretty interesting. Cute cat/dog pics reside here. If that isn't enough motivation, then what is? 1
T-shirts exchange@bphc: With the alarming number of T-shirts that are brought out by the different bodies in campus, there is a chance that you might order the wrong size. But don't worry! Post it on this group and you may find someone to exchange your shirt with to get your correct size.









Note: If you're a newcomer (fresher) to BITS, make sure to use your real name and add "BITS Hyderabad" as your place of education on your Facebook profile. This'll make it quicker for admins to verify and approve your entry to these groups.
