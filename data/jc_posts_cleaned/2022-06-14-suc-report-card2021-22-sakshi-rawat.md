The Cultural Secretary (Girls) Sakshi Rawat built her campaign supporting themes of encouraging participation, improving accessibility to competitions, and rekindling the campus culture. As of the Second Semester 2021-22, she has fulfilled 2/6 of her manifesto promises, while 1/6 is unfulfilled and the remaining 3/6 are in progress. You can find her manifesto here.



Peer Support Group (Fulfilled)



The Cultural Secretary aimed to set up support groups where students unable to join any club, department, or association could engage and learn activities they are enthusiastic about. These groups were to be organized with the cooperation of participating clubs by introducing workshops, demos, etc.&nbsp;


A discord server was created with each club having a channel being handled by the respective club POR’s. The server acted as a platform for students to clarify their queries, connect with people of similar interests and receive updates on any workshops being conducted.



Intra College Cultural Competition (Unfulfilled)



The Cultural Secretary wished for the revival of ‘Renaissance’ in the form of an intra-campus cultural competition. She hoped to boost morale and participation by reviving the Bitsian tradition. Unfortunately, Renaissance was not held for the 2020 or 2021 batch due to covid restrictions throughout and the cultural senate being occupied with Orbe Novo otherwise.



Official documentation of Cultural Senate activities (Fulfilled)



The Cultural Secretary had asked clubs to create an outline of their offline activities and events. Clubs and Assocs part of the Cultural Senate were required to prepare this official document to help guide the next elected SUC/FoB, which might struggle given their offline inexperience.



Introduction of Global Competitions and Scholarships (In Progress)



The Cultural Secretary identified a lack of awareness and accessibility to international and national scholarships and competitions. She acknowledged the limited scope that exists on campus for UN, Science, Entrepreneurship, Mathematical, etc., based on competitions and debates.


The Cultural Secretary stated that information pertaining to the above-mentioned point has been collected and was planned to be uploaded to the SUC portal. However, since the SUC portal is still in progress, the information will be released to the general body once the SU portal is launched



Inter-College Cultural Competitions (In Progress)



The development of soft skills was a significant point in the Cultural Secretary’s manifesto. She has emphasized the importance of these skills and proposed participation in external debates, elocution, essays, and dance/music competitions. Although public platforms and cultural events by embassies were mentioned, no tangible steps could have been taken to promote these events with covid restrictions in place in most colleges and universities.&nbsp;However, a database with contacts of all institutions that could possibly participate when it is conducted considering the situation has improved.



Revival of Sanskriti and more active regional associations (In Progress)



Sanskriti is a night to enjoy the diverse culture, traditions, and talents of the students at BPHC, a point emphasized by the Cultural Secretary as she tries to revive this beautiful event. Covid and online classes made a full-fledged Sanskriti night near impossible and although efforts were made, they went in vain.
