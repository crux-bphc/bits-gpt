The second one was ‘Chemictionary’ which was a fresh version of
Pictionary with engineering related words, aptly described as
‘Pictionary for the nerds’.





CEA (Civil Engineering Association)


CEA this year, came up with a novel one-day, free-of-cost designing
workshop for Revit. The workshop aimed at educating the students on the
