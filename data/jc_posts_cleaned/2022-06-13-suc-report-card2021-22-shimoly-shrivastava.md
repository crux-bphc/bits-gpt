In the academic year 2021-2022, the Sports Secretary (Girls) has fulfilled 2/7 of her manifesto points, 1/7 was partially fulfilled, and 4/7 have not been fulfilled at all. You can read her original manifesto here.



Workshops: fulfilled



Workshops were conducted for various teams at different points of time during the academic year. However, the ‘well-tabulated calendar’ was not implemented and there were some clashes with academic commitments in April.



Increasing exposure: not fulfilled



Although the basketball and frisbee teams did have friendly matches with other teams, sources have revealed that the teams were approached independently, rather than through the sports senate. There was however participation and encouragement of higher degree students in the teams.&nbsp;



Recreational activities in hostel: not fulfilled



None of the recreational activities(such as foosball tables, dart boards, hula hoops, skipping ropes, carrom boards, zumba, and yoga) that the secretary wrote about in her manifesto were implemented into the common rooms. The badminton and volleyball facilities in the QT were also not improved on and game nights were not organised.&nbsp;



Fitness clubs: not fulfilled



Clubs with a focus around aerobics, yoga, zumba, pilates etc. were not introduced in this academic year due to the isolated location of the campus.



Nutritionists: not fulfilled



The secretary did not bring in any nutritionist to hold sessions for the athletes due to the isolated location of the campus.



Initialisation: fulfilled



The swimming team was not introduced as the swimming pool is still not open for the student body. However, two other teams have been implemented in this academic year.- the girls athletics and girls cricket teams.&nbsp;



Online events: partially fulfilled



There were some interactive sessions between the girls teams and prospective members and online chess tournaments took place. However, online talks, exercise programs, nutritionists, match screenings, and publicizing of the sports teams did not take place.
