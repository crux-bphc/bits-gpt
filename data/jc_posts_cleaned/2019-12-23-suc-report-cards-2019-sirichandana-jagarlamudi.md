 As of the First Semester 2019-20, the Sports Secretary (Girls) has fulfilled 4/7 of her manifesto points, 2/7 are in progress and 1/7 have not been fulfilled at all. You can find her original manifesto here.


ORGANIZING WORKSHOPS: FULFILLED


The idea behind this point is to bring freshers to the field and she claims that the number of workshops has increased this semester. The sports secretary aims to increase the number of workshops every month for the benefit of the freshers on campus. As per the Secretary, as of the first semester, almost all sports had their respective workshops quite regularly.&nbsp;


INTRODUCTION OF A NEW SPORT: FULFILLED


Kho-Kho was introduced as a new sport despite Siri’s manifesto being about Handball. She explained this by saying that Handball could not be introduced due to inadequate facilities for the sport. Also, the field proposed for the latter seemed more appropriate for Kho-Kho, hence the change. The beginning of the semester saw the start of a new Kho-Kho team.


INCULCATING CULTURE INTO SPORTS: IN PROGRESS


There wasn’t any sports mela this semester though the proposal was to have one each semester. The secretary told us that we would instead have it as a "Pre-Arena" event in the coming semester.&nbsp;


RECREATIONAL SPORTS (HOSTEL): IN PROGRESS


Proper maintenance of the common room inventory and QT areas of the girls’ hostels is one of her manifesto points. She has raised this point in front of the concerned authorities. She told us that they responded positively and that it might take some time for leveling the QT ground. Inventory for football, volleyball, and board games would also be maintained at the hostels.&nbsp;


INCREASE EXPOSURE: FULFILLED


Each and every team from the campus has gone for friendly matches with other colleges. Also, teams from IITH came to our campus for different sports.


The basketball team has been going for friendly matches for more than a month and a half. She also claimed that the practice sessions have been happening according to the schedule.&nbsp;


STUDENTS MENTORING COMMITTEE:&nbsp; FULFILLED


A committee consisting of the vice-captains of all the sports teams was formed towards the end of September. It comprises all the vice-captains of all the sports teams. The vice-captains have been helping and encouraging new students to participate in various sports activities. The vice-captains have been taking care of all the workshops that were conducted in the last few months.  


NUTRITIONIST: NOT FULFILLED


Due to the huge expenses and the isolated location of our campus, Siri admits that we are not able to hire a nutritionist. However, she, along with Praneeth Setty (Sports Secretary - Boys) has planned to bring a nutritionist to the campus a week before Arena.&nbsp;
