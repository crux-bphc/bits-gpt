From the title, it is clear, what the matter in this article is going to be. Elections are one of the worst times in college life. Only one thing is not fake during this period, which is the below the belt campaigning and dirty manipulation just for the sake of a position. This article is not an exaggeration but is as presented, witnessed, recalled and processed by the people concerned.


Let us start with a particular divide that exists in clubs, called the member-enthusiast distinction. The way this used to function is that an enthusiast who works hard or gets better at that activity eventually becomes a member. However, this is hardly true nowadays. The clubs that exist on campus are first, too many. Second, the justifications for work dynamics and activities given is so lame that the whole club’s existence seems pointless. Third, the clubs that are actually worthy fall prey to the politics of the North-South divide.


Speaking of clubs or departments for that matter, there are some clubs/departments that are predominantly either “gult” or “Northie”. What this actually means is a long story, which in short, suggests cheap politics and dirty manipulation. So if they are predominantly like this, then what changes during the elections? Well these clubs or departments do not change; the ones that change are partialities or the ones with almost equal proportions of the two groups. In this, either the heads decide to select a member of choice to lead the club or the prospective candidates reach a mutual understanding and elections are evaded.


If there is a rebel who stands up still, thinking that he/she has worked hard enough to get a post, there is the so called tampering of – the enthu/member lists. This is true and is unquestionable because if the head loses the ethics, it becomes a lost cause.


Coming to the elephant in the room that is the focus of everything in life, if not for everyone at least for the candidates who are contesting the SU elections. Day-night campaigning and most of all negative and anti-campaigning. The most important point used in this pointless noise pollution is the gult card for some and the Hindi-Hindi Bhai Bhai for the rest. There are few people who do not fall prey to either. Not because they do not belong to either groups but due to the basic fact that they look beyond these things.


After everything, it boils down to ethics and many things stay hanging in this obscurity. It is useless pointing out names, everyone does it and they will continue to do so

After all, so much for the country you are born in, and genetics are only superficial, the environment influences mind-sets and ethical ideologies.


Jai Hind!
