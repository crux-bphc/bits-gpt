# How can I prepare for BITS Higher Degree examination?
## u/ShellyOnTheG0 (Score: 3) (Flair: Future BITSian)
I'm a recent passed out graduate currently working in FinTech. I want to do my M.tech in Computer Science or Software Engineering.

I know that the exam will be in May. How can I prepare for it? How difficult will be the test?
Please help me with the resources and material that helps my preparation.

Suggestions would be helpful. Thanks in advance.

The test is easier than GATE.
But the syllabus covered is pretty vast, I would suggest you to study breadthwise for the test.

I got admitted through GATE for ME CS but had a Software Systems offer as well. 
Can't guide you much about BITS HD CS preparation but I know about SS paper.

The SS paper had GATE PYQs mostly. If you have prepped well for GATE it should be a cakewalk.

For resources and all search for BITS ME Study group on facebook.
