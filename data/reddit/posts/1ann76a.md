# Working with professors on research.
## u/dovaknokovich (Score: 7) (Flair: Academics)
I am a first year student interested in learning more about some aspects of our Gen Bio course ...
One of the professors is doing his research on the areas I am interested in...

Could I ask him whether I could work with him on his research? If yes, how should I approach him?

Also, did anybody in their first years do something like this?

go to the prof in their office hours (ideally mailing them prior), discuss your interests with them, and ask if you can lend a hand in some of their research projects

SOPs etc the institute only lets you take up 2-2 onwards so you won't get academic credit for it till then

but I guess if your motivation lies beyond that then that's not an issue for you

Profs probably won't take you up for a SOP in first year, especially since you aren't in bio. You can always ask for something informal though.

Bro, I'm also a student from Bits hyd. I can suggest but first, you must take everything lite. It would be best if you take care of your health first. If you're not healthy, you can't be productive. First, you must learn what helper T cells are and work according to that. Then, you can think about joining some research programmes.

I'm assuming you are in MSc Bio? If so then you could definitely talk to them about this, they'll probably ask you to read a few papers so that you get a better idea of what they really work on.
