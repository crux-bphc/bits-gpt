Is bits really really difficult if i get in through the ISA and have not studied for bits sat or jee. Moreover, I studied the Cambridge A level syllabus in 11th and 12th.

Realistically what are the expected cutoffs for BITSAT 2024? Asking as an aspirant. Looking forward to join the civil engineering department as Iâ€™m not interested in other branches.

I am an international student who holds a US passport, I wrote SAT and was thinking of applying for BITS through ISA scheme with my SAT scores. I later found out, even international students can get admission in BITS through BITS exam. So I was wondering, do I get a normal admission and pay the same fees as an Indian student if I go through BITS exam or do I still have to pay the same fees as in ISA scheme fee structure??? In which case writing BITS exam is not useful for me, as I can get admission through my SAT scores directly.
