How can I get a job at McKinsey, Bain, or BCG? What kind of profile do I need to have to break into these firms? Is it necessary to be a part of the consulting club or 180DC? It would be really helpful if a senior could guide me in this regard.

1.Easiest way is by being a girl or having a relative in those companies already, who can refer you.


2. Otherwise, spam join those 'Business development/analyst internships', join the consulting clubs, learn to lie as easily and confidently as you breathe, and inflate your resume amd work experience by proving to them that you can handle big money quite well. This will give you some chance against the people qualifying through criteria 1.

Have spikes in your interview, great English speaking, academics should be great, 9/9/9 likes, MBB usually come for 2 roles, pure consultant and data analyst sort of. Pure consultant is 30lpa ish and mostly after mba, before is mostly sql etc. But brush up greatly on case studies abd guesstimates , there is a book called case in point, a great one. Also remember case studies would in helpful in interviews, so you have to clear pre rounds before that like mckinsey game. So focus on that too. Rest I m not from bits and have seen 7cg girls getting placed too, but for guys 8cg should be there or other spikes to compensate for that. Also lek is also there, good pay and all. Attaching gds of 2 companies below, m and lek

As someone rightfully highlighted: spikes in your resume. You need to stand out. Spikes can be through academics, research experience, internships and PoRs on campus (this is the order of precedence). As for internships, there's your holy trinity: Product, Founder's Office and Venture Capital/Finance. They'll make you stand out well. Also, don't rely on consulting for placements. Shortlists and company requirements are very random. By having spikes in your resume, you can only increase your odds, not guarantee it.

PS: Keep your CG as high as possible because companies will only shortlist you on this basis in a bad market like the current one.
