How do you get your protein in? I had a good first sem and plan to lift religiously this sem so I'm curious how I could get 200g of protein each day

(8 eggs at breakfast+ 2 scoops whey only make 100 and I don't feel good spending 150 for 40g of protein at ANC everyday)

Why do you need 200gms? Even if you weigh 80kgs, 130gms of protein is good enough. If you weigh ~70kgs, 130gms would be more than enough.

Add chicken to lunch or dinner, and a packet of tofu as evening snack, soyabean/chicken/paneer on last slot (lunch/dinner). Eat a lot of fibre and thandi taseer wali cheeze (lassi/gond kadeera/ watermelon) or else digestion will take a hit, and back acne.
Also, if you are 100 kg with not that shredded muscle mass, like 20%+ body fat, can go for little less 160-180 range. 200+ is a lot different and remember consistency is the key

Was in your situation, can help with this. Continue with 8-12 eggs a day (jitna ho pae, don't eat if you're feeling queasy), mix your whey with 500ml milk for extra protein. Get the rest of your protein from mess food, daal chhole rajma soya chunks paneer whatever you're getting don't worry too much about it just eat it till you're full, leave the gravy portion. Have rotis during lunch and/or dinner as per your carb requirements, wheat has gluten protein so you can use that to fill up. On Tuesdays when no egg breakfast, have grilled chicken from ANC. 110 for about 50 gms of protein (the chicken breast they serve is p. big). 

Essentially, excluding the 8 eggs and 2 scoops of whey, you'll have to build it up bit by bit. Hitting 150 will be easy, 200 ke liye you might have to do something like get extra eggs during lunch/dinner. 

Or just get merit scholarship and eat grilled chicken at anc everyday.
