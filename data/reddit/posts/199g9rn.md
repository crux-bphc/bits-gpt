I installed the app to check and found that they need contact permissions to start the app

So any friends of yours gave the permission and from there the message is delivered to you

Really cheap tactics...

HaveÂ youÂ everÂ signedÂ upÂ forÂ anyÂ freeÂ collegeÂ festÂ passes?
ItÂ isÂ possibleÂ toÂ getÂ theseÂ kindsÂ ofÂ messagesÂ ifÂ thatÂ is theÂ case.

Your some friend has given contact permission to Slick app

They use this contact information and contact everyone with the Phone number with same message

Few months ago even i used to get that message now I dont.
But this is just data things imagine you didn't even create your account and still your mobile number is getting sold to other third party companies lol
