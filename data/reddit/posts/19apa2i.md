# Min CG for reverse Dual?
## u/BromateIon13 (Score: 4) (Flair: Academics)
I am currently in EEE and want to move to MSc  Math while keeping EEE as my bachelor's degree. What's the minimum cg required for this change? Also, if I opt for a reverse dual degree, will my ID be B4A3 or A3B4?

Talk to AUGSD, no one else can really give you a solid number for this since it's a very rare transfer.
