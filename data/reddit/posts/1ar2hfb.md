Better question would be what were your scores in the first session, as many people improve in the second one and 24tards are only done with the first one.

ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èasking here won‚Äôt change your score. Prepare for other exams if any remaining. In the larger scheme of things it wouldn‚Äôt even matter. I have colleagues from all kinds of undergrad colleges. Be consistent.

Sincerely,
