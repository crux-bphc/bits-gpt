# Acads have made me very depressed

I am a first year in hyderabad

AUGSD has introduced exit tests for our batch. Missing even 1 class means possibly losing a grade. I don't know if I have any mental issue like ADHD (My parents wont let me test because being diagnosed with mental illness is a matter of shame in society) but I find any live lecture difficult to remember. Self study is the only way for me. From 11th class I have been attending offline coaching, learning absolutely nothing, and then relearning everything at home through youtube. I thought atleast after joining BITS I won't be forced to go to lectures. Unfortunately exit tests were introduced to the very campus I chose. In sem 1, I haven't spoken to any person other than my roommate, I made no friends, joined no clubs. I spent the mornings attending classes and evening studying from youtube/books.  


Losing grades gives me severe anxiety. I wakeup many times in the middle of night thinking about losing marks. I have had panic attacks about marks many times. I went to classes even though I was very sick (because exit tests are surprise tests in some courses). My mental health has been completely destroyed. I sit in classes knowing my time is being wasted. I keep feeling that I am wasting my life away. Why am I listening to classes if I have to relearn everything anyway? If I don't get high CG I wont get placed. My life will get ruined. These are the thoughts in my head.  I still have to suffer for 3 years.  What do I do? My college life is getting wasted in front of my eyes and I am unable to do anything.

Exit tests are only 10% of the grade so even if u attend just half the classes you can still score well

a. High cg doesn't gaurantee good placements, low cg doesn't mean you'll remain unplaced. Your happiness and sanity is way more important than a 5-10 percent grade component. People miss quizzes and still get 9s and 10s, it is okay to miss a few classes man. Live life a bit, nobody will remember you grades in Cp or gen chem, but the connections and memories that you make in college will last you a lifetime. Feel free to dm, I'm a 4th yearite from hyd itself

If you really feel you can score good enough with self study, skip classes as you wish. I have friends who have A/A- while not giving most exit tests. 10% doesnâ€™t affect your CG as much as you believe.

Chill bro nothing to worry about... Exit test in some subject are easy to score while in some require regular participation, as of me I really fucked up my exit test in sem 1 scoring almost 0 in all sub still don't know why, but there are chances if you score very well in quizes,midsem you are ahead of many and need not to worry much then, same happened with me I didn't score well in my quizes and midsem and was stressed out due to compre pressure,, moreover feel free to dm and talk.

Yo if you ever need someone to talk to in hyd campus, just DM. If you wanna make more friends, I think your best chance is to talk to the people who sit next to you in the classes you attend (I'm sure you already have a certain place you sit at everyday, talk to people who sit around there). Talk to them frequently enough and soon you'll find some group of mutual friends.
