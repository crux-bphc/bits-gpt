Get fin minor. Keep very high cg. Hope you get PS2 in IB and then hope you get a PPO.

VC and PE are very hard to break into even from IIM ABC so just forget about them until you get an MBA and even IB roles youâ€™ll get as an undergrad will be limited to back office but even they are very difficult to get.

If you want to get into front end IB/VC/PE then top IIMs are the only way. Most of the people spend some time in IB before switching to PE/VC because it is easier that way and you understand the industry better.

If you have startup experience it really helps in VC.

It's a long shot to get into IB and PE from engineering background at most we get 5-6 roles every year across all campuses and most of them are through PS2, I'd suggest get knowledgeable in finance and get into something more achievable like credit rating, analyst etc. 
Do an MBA and then break into these fields.
