is the arihant bitsat prep guide actually helpful? People either say its super helpful, or that its highly irrelevant, should I complete it fully or just practice a few questions to see how they are set

Has anybody bought the mathongo bitsat test series? Its 4000 Rs and I'm not sure if the price is justified. Anybody who has bought it this year or bought it before please tell if it's worth it, along with pros and cons. Thanks!

I'm an IB student that is eligible for the BITS ISA scheme. I wanted to know if there are any other students who got in submitting their SAT scores and IB marks. Couple of questions:

1. What's a good SAT score to get into a good Engineering/ compsci course? The cutoffs seem too low
2. There is a clause regarding the required subjects for IB:  **Students need to have 3 subjects at HL (Physics, Mathematics, and one of Chemistry/Biology/Biotechnology/any other technical vocational subject) and 3 subjects at SL is made eligible for Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Science Integrated programmes.** My third 'technical vocational' subject is at an SL level not HL. I have taken the appropriate math and physics. Might I be considered for the engineering courses (and has anyone else in the same situation gotten admission)? 

(FYI: I've sent many mails to the BITS ISA office but was told that I would only receive details on my second question once the 'eligibility criteria' is out. Seemed like they were just stalling, idk)
