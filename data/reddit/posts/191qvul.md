I prolly wont be able to arrive on time for registration tomm, will it be a big hassle? Late reg is on 16th, ik i can still go to classes, but what about labs, how will i know which section to attend? Are briefings graded? And also mow which has attendance grading for tuts, so i can't just, would that affect my overall attendance?
