Seeing the success of the of the comedy club at bphc, i think we also need one of those fr. Mime is a great club but mime as a subgenre of comedy seems good. Standup, skits ,memes etc are the current big genres that am pretty sure many people on campus are intrested in doing too. Our campus has had a legacy of comedians with a comicstann winner(nishant suri) in stanndup , thw admin of appchutiyehai a political satire page and ofc the campus goat our daddy supreme leader(idk how to categorise him but shit he does is hillarious roz subha uthke uski stories dekhta hu day made) . But overall i feel this club needs to be formed might as well be the place where people start their standup journey while engineering rather than starting it after graduation due to joblessness(inevitable).

Came as a surprise to me being in Hyderabad that goa is missing a comedy club.. Comedy club is the most awaited at any inaug event here.. some of their skits have reached publicity at pan india level too
