# Is BITS Pilani's reputation dying?
## u/False_Error9116 (Score: 0) (Flair: Future BITSian)
Recently whenever I talk about bits with my teachers or some of the bitsians I know personally they don't really talk very highly about BITS. Seniors tell that the overall culture has died and there is not much junior senior interaction. 
Even the placements are declining and a lot of students are going unplaced.

BITS Pilani cannot control the recession happening in the market rn, so the placement going down is not a fault of these colleges. But these jee kids don't even think about these things so that's why we get such stupid questions.

Not sure how much of this is relevant but quoting a senior. (2018)

You're looking at things in the eyes of an aspirant. In the eyes of a recruiter or any professional, BITS will remain top as long as the BITSian culture doesn't die. If you still think my "BITS will always remain tier-1" remark was biased, just go through linkedin.

Some of us asked the HR in our internship why they came to BITS for hiring, and why wasn't there any pre-interview test for us. She said that they don't have to test the knowledge level of BITSians. This same firm hires only from 2 other IITs (B,D). 100s of companies (top brands in their resp. industries) continue and will continue to take in BITSians without taking an interview. The publicity of 2017 fee-hike protests did not impact this view.

Is there a relation between BITSAT/JEE score and quality of students? Not at all. You could have more upper-class students getting in, but that doesn't imply a deterioration in quality. Maybe we'll have to stop with the "no reservation" remark that made us flaunt in front of IIT/NITians. However, the BITSian culture must remain intact and must be passed from batch to batch (which was a big threat during covid). If this stops, then value will surely decrease and BITS would just become equivalent to DU.

As a side note, there are much bigger threats that BITS faces as compared to fee hikes, right from admin incompetency, to a lack of research-focused mindset.

Har saal ka randi rona hai. I have sat through intern placements this year and fwiw it has been significantly better than what most of us expected. The reputation of this college has significantly gone up in my eyes for sure, compared to what it was when I had joined.

Full time placements have been dogshit everywhere and a lot of people at every top college went unplaced this year.

I don't see how come you expected a neutral response on wheter BITS's reputation is dying on a subreddit of BITSians (most of them who are proud of their college).

In my biased opinion, no. I don't understand what you mean by the overall culture? Senior - Junior interaction atleast here in Hyderabad is still the same. About placements, yeah its true. What you miss out is that it is happening in every other college (even Top IITs and IIMs). [though from what i have heard, goa is apparently is going down a shithole - cant confirm though]

I swear har mahine one of you guys ask this. Pehle get enough in the BITSAT to even have this as an option and then ask stuff like this.

BITS is , was and ,unless a comet hits Pilani campus, always will be the best private college in India.

Bits is better than all the nits in my opinion be it anything infra, culture, Peer group 
Only top 3 nits compare bits to it's placements but still bits is slightly better than them 
Bits will always be in tier 1 league as it takes time to build reputation and trust in the industry 
Also the positive side Bits has non reservation so just consider u can get good branches here circuital or cs which is pretty difficult in top 3 nits or top 12 iits for a gen male candidate . And what decling placements 
In my opinion if u have cs above 25 and circuital around 20 median this is a tier 1 college and now it all depends upon your hardwork to get ur placement
