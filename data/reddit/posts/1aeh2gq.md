BITS Pilani is great for a lot of things but you need to set your expectations accordingly.

* Professors aren't what make the college good/elite/higher in rankings. In fact, I'd go out to say that most profs here don't know much about the courses they take. A lot of courses are just copied directly from NPTEL, leaving you wondering what is the point of paying for your degree.
* Admin has got a stick up its ass. For all the freedom that the university claims to give, a lot of things are just stopped by the slow, power hungry, bureaucratic ~~people~~ vermin in multiple places (AUGSD for acads, CPU for club work, etc.).
* Research culture is dogshit. Professors here are teachers first, researchers ~~second~~ later. Few exceptions exist, YMMV.
* There is hardly any interaction between BE students and ME/PhD folks. Most higher degree students are just here for a tag, and are then used by profs to do menial labour (for a lack of a better term).

EDIT:  Removed the last point cuz people were focusing on a, frankly, insignificant part of the rant.

Unfortunately, that's true for almost ALL Indian colleges, even the best of IITs and IIMs have a lot of shitty teachers from what I've heard from friends and relatives who've studied there. So for people who aren't loaded from the get-go, there ain't any better options in this department

This is what frustrates me the most about BITS. All the talk about being a student-run community, only to find out that a lot of the issues for students exist cause the admin was lazy and did the bare minimum expected. PSD and PU, for all the talk about being able to hand good placements without having a govt backing, lack the intellect to coordinate simple shit and be transparent to the students who've trusted them to get things done.

&gt;There is definitely a vast difference in terms of student quality (which is honestly what makes the college good) between the three campuses, you'll know by looking at the rankings.

This is a very subjective statement tbh. Obviously, if you compare an average Hyd Civil guy vs an avg Pilani CS guy in terms of pure grasping and analytical skill, there's no contest here. However, the student's "quality" fully depends on the environment that he's in, and the opportunities provided to them. Hence, a Hyd Civil guy who's killed it in CP or is the President of 180DC, will probably trump the Pilani CS guy who's slacking off and sleeps in his room all day.

Blud check the 2023 cutoffs. There's hardly a 15-16 mark difference between same branch at Pilani, Goa and Hyderabad. A lot of ppl have been choosing Goa/Hyderabad over Pilani due to location and other factors. The top 21 ppl in my branch out of 78 at Goa were getting the same branch at Pilani. BITSAT marks ain't even a measure of quality. My friend who had a rank 5k greater than me in Advanced got Pilani Eco cos he had 3 marks more than me in BITSAT whereas I missed the cutoff by 1 mark and in Goa Eco.

\- Well, it is the research done by them that matters a lot in rankings. So Profs do have a say in the rankings. In the long run, it will be endowments from alumni that will pave the way to better rankings.

\- Bureaucracy is an issue even in the elitest of institutes. BITS is not the only one.

\- Fair. The root problem is the lack of funding and lack of enthusiastic researchers. 

\- Again, true everywhere else. However, exceptions exist, especially if you do research or projects in a Prof's lab (not common among undergrads). I've had good interactions with ME/PhD folks through this.

Funds are on the rise, so it's a good sign for the future. But I really hope more professional and experienced alumni's thoughts are considered in admin decisions.

I disagree with this. Personally I had quite a bit of interaction with ME folk, particularly when I took up LOP/DOPs which required me to go to a lab and do the work. I also met a few ME seniors who I still talk to by playing tennis casually.


The only thing I'd say is that you have to go up to them to talk. They'll hardly if ever approach BE folk themselves. Do keep that in mind.


The rest of your points are fair enough.

Speak for yourself. **You** don't have any interaction because you don't participate in labs and projects.
