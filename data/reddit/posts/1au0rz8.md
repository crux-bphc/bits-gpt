# Are you allowed gap years in BITS?

I don't mean drop years before admission or gap years for startups. I just wanted to ask whether you can take semesters off or gap years in BITS? Couldn't find any info on this online. Thanks!

My sibling had a medical situation and was allowed to take a year off for recovery. Guess you just need to produce genuine proof. This was sometime back. Idk if rules have changed as of now. Good luck!
