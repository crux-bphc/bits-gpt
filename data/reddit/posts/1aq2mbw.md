# How is Civil Engineering in BITS?
## u/Veer_Savage_8 (Score: 33) (Flair: Academics)
I come from a lineage of contractors and builders in the construction industry, so I’m only interested in pursuing Civil Engineering. Let’s say the fees is not the issue at all and I’m just looking forward to take up civil engineering in either Pilani or Hyderabad. What cutoffs can I expect? I’m not satisfied with my JEE Main score but I can manage 75+ in boards. I only want to study up to the level of civil engineering, not CSE or ECE etc.

It's easy to get civil, just study your ncert thoroughly then practice a lot of questions and give a few mocks, even if you are targeting June attempt there's still plenty of time to ace the exam, so ATB

Hyderabad Campus has better equipment in the labs. That's why I chose Hyderabad Campus.
