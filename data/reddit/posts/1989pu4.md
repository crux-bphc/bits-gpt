# Regarding the Mental Health Cell on Campus

I would like to know about how MPower is regarding confidentiality and the way they proceed with therapy, while solving a person's mental health issue. Is it a good idea seeking help from them ?

It depends on the therapist but my experience with MPower was very positive. I would highly recommend approaching the cell and booking an appointment.

You can seek primary advice and counselling from them, if your case is serious you might have to get yourself checked from a hospital. Don't take consultation from the female counsellor at m-power she's gonna confuse more than help you only consult the male counsellor.
