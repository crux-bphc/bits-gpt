To the girl who was wearing a oversized (extremely oversized) blue hoodie and walking with one other girl into the gymg at 6 pm today - I hope you know that you're one of the cutest people I've ever met. I just hope you know that. I don't know which batch you're in, but if you're single, hmu. If any of you guys know who she is, work the internet magic pleaseðŸ˜‚ all I know is that she was wearing a massive huge blue hoodie and was with one other friend at the gymg at 6. Even if you don't wanna hmu, just know that you're beautiful, and I hope you're happy.
