Is their Job only opening and closing registration on ERP?

I went in with help for my degree planning because I missed last sem (3-1) due to some health issues.

I paid the 3-1 fees too and I'm trying to talk to them and they're like the most unfriendly people Ive ever seen.

Also, fuck the student coordinators man, I mean get a beter fake job

Student coordinators are the most incompetent people I have ever seen . All of them are against the students when we take any complaints ND not only that they also convince augsd to not take any of our words seriously. When it's about registration of important cdc, dels,minors they just laugh at us saying it's our fault.

Mail Biju directly, he might help. My friend missed sem 1 registration due to some health issues, Biju allowed him to register 1 month later when he came to campus.
