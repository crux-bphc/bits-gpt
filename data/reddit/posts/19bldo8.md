How does a 9+ CG help? Is it limited only to placements? What are the other benefits?

Higher studies and MCN/Merit. Plus, feels nice to have a distinction mentioned on the degree.

Sometimes it might be disadvantageous for placements.

You can get Apple in PS2  and Amazon or JIO in PS1 with that CG. Also, in  placements the cut off you see on superset may say 7.5+ but when shortlisting if 2 guys perform similarly in OA, guy with better CG gets shortlisted. I have personally seen it happen in SI season.

You will have a better chance to get into the top universities around the world for a Master's degree, keeping it a 9.5+ can even land you the top 10 universities in the world. If research is something you want to do, research interns via programs like MITACS and DAAD will become easier to obtain as they usually require stellar grades, particularly DAAD.

It will be easier for you to get a better PS for both PS-1 and PS-2. In placements, if two candidates are of equal caliber almost, there might be a shortlist benefiting you because of your high CGPA. Also, a good CGPA generally means a better understanding of the course content which is beneficial as well.
