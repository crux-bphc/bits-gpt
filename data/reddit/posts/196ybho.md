Haven't slept through the night, tried sleeping then end up watching movies and watching random videos on youtube. Feeling just plain empty from within, have so much to do..acads , coding ,music production, sports but can't make myself do anything. Don't know what's happening with me...it's like i don't feel anything.

in situations like this, if you are just feeling down (not depression) look for some change.
May be just visit a calming place or just take a break and do a deep sleep.

Just do your best

Could be a defense mechanism, first acknowledge you have alot on ur plate, make mini goals for every thing, like 1 concept in acad or 1 component in a module for coding.Â
