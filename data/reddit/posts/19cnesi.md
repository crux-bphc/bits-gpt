They get enough fees every year to install centralized air conditioning units in every hostel. I say keep using heaters until this corrupt fucking administration does justice to the amount of fees being paid.

I see these kind of stuff happen and think why the admin wants to make things difficult for the students ?. 

My friends in Manipal were telling how people used to set their rooms on fire for fun .

Simple solution is install MCB panels instead.

15A is still a lot of current to use in appliances. The smaller sockets are of 5A n the bigger ones of 15A. I doubt anyone uses beyond that in households too. Imo you can still do fine with heater or appliances of wattage 2~3k W which is a good amount of power.
