According to erp it shows (choose 4 B5 electives from the list) credits as 15, so 4 three cred electives won't satisfy the requirement?

No. You need to do at least 4 courses which are B5 electives AND at least 15 units worth of courses. In other words, you need to satisfy both the minimum number of courses taken (4) AND the minimum unit requirement (15).
