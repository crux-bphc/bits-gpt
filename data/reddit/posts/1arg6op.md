40 lakhs can be considered after everything included (travelling, electronics, etc). But youâ€™ll also earn in your PS and summer internship so you can safely round it off to 35

Total fees comes out to be 34.25L including all expenses that a Dualite will have to pay. 

This includes the admission fees, tuition fees, SU fees, hostel and electricity fees, mess fees. 

PS fees has been taken into account.

Itna toh spend karna hi hoga 5 saal ki degree pe. Baaki tum apna snacks aur khud ka kharcha jod lo.

Just remember don't add the 80k for summer term each year that is not required to be paid normally by any student
