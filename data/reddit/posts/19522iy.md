QUERY REGARDING BITSAT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

There are rumours that BITSAT will not except improvement marksheet even if appeared for l the subs in the CBSE as a private candidate.

Will I've to reappear for whole 12th ? But how is that possible I've already passed all the exams in the CBSE 2023 there's no option of reappearance after that maybe I can reapeat my whole 11th and 12th but this doesn't makes any sense.
