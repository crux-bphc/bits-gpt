# Advice needed ..this state of confusion is messing me up

Ok, so I am friends with this one girl from the last semester(2-1) and we are currently in 2-2 but the thing is we hardly go to classes so most of our conversation is mainly on texting and I've met her only like 3-4 times

Initially, our conversations started by resolving each other's academic doubts, but strangely, our discussions remain solely focused on academic matters. We only talk about tutorial tests, labs, midterms, and final exams. During holidays or other non-academic times, we don't even text each other.

This has been going on for a while, making it uncomfortable to bring up other topics unrelated to academics. I am confused about the nature of our relationship.

Am I getting used, should I stop talking to her or wtf am I supposed to do to make conversation more interesting, should I meet her in person more? but the problem is we both don't go to classes and also I always have my friends around(they are jerks) which is why even if she is around we usually don't talk to each other (also I'm shy)..... this shit has been draining my mental energy recently and I would appreciate any advice/dm/help.

Just start talking about some other common topic. If she vibes, great. If she doesn't, oh well. It wouldn't have succeeded anyway

Friends with Acads has been a thing in insti since I've stepped in here, so take care not to become one.

The rest , You don't really need to force a conversation. If you have some common ground outside Acads , that's a start. 

And if she doesn't really text you apart from Acads , best to leave it to chance lol.

This sums it up. Convos are double sided. Dono hath se taali bajti Hai. If thus really is the case you're smart enough to know the exact kind of relationship you guys have.

Try initiating a talk about something non academic a few more times..
If she shuts it down, then leave it.
It's really hard to say with girls they can actually like you and keep the conversation minimum.
Ask her to tell you what you mean to her, and in return you do the same.. probably that will help you gain clarity.

Stop texting ig. If she genuinely wanna talk, she'll text. Why tf let any girl occupy your mental space so much.

Bhai phle baat krke mood Jana ker, thoda bhot joke krne ka try ka ,even a little healthy flirting is okay ,see if she is responding well to it. If she is ,then good for you . Eventually you will find some common ground to talk. Some happy or sad things of life to share. Key to it is don't stop communicating. Message her daily or in one or two days, it's required to keep talking more in initial days,if you are trying to build something out of it. Uska fav movies ,music jano - then aap movie /song sunke/ dek ke  tell her what u felt about it. Etc etc .

That doesn't qualify for 'friends' imo, you guys are acquaintances at best. Discussing acads and answering doubts is also probably beneficial to you too, but you aren't obligated to talk to her if you don't want to.

If you really want to develop a kind of relationship with her, you need to know more about her. You could ask her for a study session together in the library where you can clear each other's doubts and study together. and after that just ask her out for lunch or dinner and then you can talk about non academic related things.
