# What is the innovation scene like at BITS?

So you know how these new universities like Plaksha are popping up and saying "join us because we will help you solve world problems and innovate", and that got me to wondering, how is the innovation scene at BITS (any campus)?

I hear a lot about startups coming out of BITS, but for some reason, some of them seem very scammy (no offense to anyone) but are there any startups that come out of BITS that solve problems that no one company in the *world* is solving, by making something new?

What have startups from IITs done? Just copied western countries and applied the same concepts in India. People who solve real world problems don't give importance to college. It doesn't matter from which college you come. What matter is your idea and execution.

This is a BITS Alumni startup (though it's a full-fledged unicorn now) , which is genuinely one of its kind in the world and is used extensively by Silicon valley giants as well.

Indian startups in general do not have a good reputation of delivering, the few who do, do very well.

You're not entirely wrong, there are a bunch of "scammy" startups on campus started because they had nothing better to do and its easy as fuck to get invested in by PIEDS. But there's also a lot of very real startups founded by BITSian grads, a few Google searches will answer that bit for you.

And innovation goes beyond startups. Tech teams and research culture on campus is an important factor. Pretty sure unis like Plaksha would be no match to BITS in that regard either.
