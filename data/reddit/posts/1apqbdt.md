Core is a good option at 8+ CG. Gate ke through PSU bhi Ja sakte ho, if that's what you are into. And yes, Slumberger does come to our college. Core companies kam aate hai campus main, and they do offer a lower package (except a few), but unless you are in civil, it's not non-existent. You just have to be consistent in your acads. 

And there are a few core companies, that do take up people at lower CG, but you will generally want to avoid those companies. 

Do something alongside it just to be safe, and to have a certain flexibility. Either take up a minor or go into coding and DSA.
