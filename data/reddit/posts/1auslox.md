Hi, I was wondering if I could live at my home and visit the campus only for exams (I've heard attendance is not compulsory).

You can opt for a day pass which you can use to just go home outside working hours (9am to 5pm weekdays and till 1pm.on Saturdays). Otherwise you'll have to pay hostel and mess fees like everyone else.

don't know if you can live outside campus or not, but you will miss out on a lot. Personality isn't developed inside classrooms. It is developed inside the college premises.
