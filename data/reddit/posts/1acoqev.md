took chemical at goa campus, now really confused what to do.

no core scope, low placements, IT companies don't allow, boards scores are bad so MBA not an option..  what do I do?? itna recession that even cs/ece guys aren't placed

galti kardi kya core branch leke? I thought BITS is like IITs but I think I was wrong idk, I think only CS/Phoenix has value in BITS.

Not being mean, but do you think Chemical core placements are thriving and growing with leaps and bounds at IITs in that case? 

The recession part is true, but that's just part of the market cycle for now, cause Covid did happen if you recall which fucked up the economic systems of the world for good. 

&gt;I think only CS/Phoenix has value in BITS

I know this could be rude but bhai tu first-yearite hoke aise conclusions pe directly kaise jump kar gaya? This is probably on you cause you simply didn't do enough research before joining.

**I'd say use the rest of your first year to figure out what domain you have an interest in: finance, consulting, entrepreneurship, ML-AI, IT or maybe even Chemical core**. Study hard parallelly, and then maybe you won't be as confused.

Companies coming to BITS do give you a fair bit of freedom to sit for other domains during PS-2 and Placements so saying no scope and low placements is genuinely your skill issue if you don't care about acads and building your profile.

Damm bro , even I am from chemical but my point of view is completely opposite of yours . I feel that BITS gives me a lot of opportunities , I can go in finance roles , product management roles , tech roles and ofc I can also go in core roles with a decent beginner pay (ofc not equal to that of CSE ) . I mainly plan to do MBA after doing a job for couple of years and dont regret taking chemical at all.

Mahan ho bhai! ek line mai college ko bhi judge kar diya! Chem guys earning in 30-40s LPA from my batch and it has been just 3 years after graduation. Go and talk to seniors please. Recession has an effect everywhere, IITB mech and chem placements pata karna ek baar.

It is you problem ngl. And chemical placements aren't thriving anywhere so you tell me. Regardless the same PSUs show up anyway

IT companies don't allow !?

80-85% IT firms in sem-2 allow all branches ( most people of mech chem, eee, eni go for sem-2. Majority Cs, 35-40% ece go for sem-1) . To have access to all firms which allow chemE you need a good gpa( 7+ min., ideally 7.5+) . Lying b/w 6-7 will still give you access to 60% of them but there is a chance especially in this kind of market when after clearing the technical round, companies shortlists candidates based on GPA and branch but those are things which you can't control.

Imo you are in a good place rn , you just need to focus on getting decent grades and upskill yourself. If you are in 1st/2nd year , you have plenty of time to do DSA, Cloud, AIML. 

Finance/APM/analytics are also your options. Talk to seniors around you, you'll realise you have a world of opportunities. Just keep in mind CG at bits is valued. Getting 8+ irrespective of the branch will make your journey smooth asf in everything ( SIP, good PS2, masters) . If not 8+ , try to keep it 7+( not tough in chemical) . Lying b/w 6-7 is a pain and you'll realise you will be undervalued by some companies because of your grades.

I did my Chemical Engineering at BITS Pilani. Some of the people I know got placed in Analyst roles and SDE roles from Chemical as well with packages above 16-17 LPA. Some people even got into companies like Schlum, Mondelez and HUL with even higher packages around 25-30 LPA. Also there is a possibility of doing a Masters abroad, I believe one can easily earn more than your stated figures if they work hard enough.

Chemical is a good degree, like yea placement might not be there but if u can land urself a job on ur own finding, chemical industry has a lot of scope and prospects you can go into a no. of fields and experience an exponential growth

It all depends, a friend did Chemical Engineering (not from BITS), and, he is doing well today in his core domain, currently he is in the US, he always liked Chemical Engineering and similar stuff, you have time on your hands, so think seriously, and, do a brutally honest review of your self and your choices, only you can do this as no one else knows you better; did you join Chemical as you like it, and, want to make a Career out of it for a good portion of your life ?
