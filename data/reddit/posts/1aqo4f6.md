Iâ€™ll just leave this here. BITS Mumbai is not BITS.

India isn't a first world country for design courses to be considered "premium". While the idea of diversification is something that should be respected and even supported to some extent, I hope all this leeway the chancellor seems to be making use of doesn't dilute the brand name which was, to a great extent built greatly due to the handsome monetary compensations grabbed by its engineering alumni. I hope India sees a day when career paths other than the mainstream society approved handful are not looked down upon.

Placements aukaat dikha denge. Agar campus me dum hoga to placements bhi vaise hi hoge.
