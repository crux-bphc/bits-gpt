# Fee structure diff for isa
## u/[deleted] (Score: 6) (Flair: Future BITSian)
I want to know if there will be a fee difference between going through DASA or taking the BITS exam. From my calculations, the total for four years will be around 80 lakhs, which I want to avoid.
Pls tell me which mode of entrance should I opt for?
SAT or bits entrance
