I'm in my 2-2, CSE, and wants to participate in Hackathons, but don't know how to start, is it like I should start participating to get some exposure or like I should have my technical skills sharpened to try winning.
It would be great if you could provide a detailed guide on what language/domain to focus on etc.stuff

PS: It would be great if I could connect with someone who had great experience of hackathons.

Not an CSE student, in Goa campus Moveworks organised a "HackAIthon". Went into it with no experience in AI &amp; ML at all, figured out the technologies there itself. How to webscrape, how to find open source AI model &amp; how to train them etc. I remember my team not sleeping the whole night &amp; try to keep figuring out. That is the nature hackathons, you learn as you build. Plus it is a great way to get started with projects for your CV! 

It is sad the frequency of on campus hackathons have reduced drastically.
