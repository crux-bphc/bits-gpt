People have a lot of thoughts when it comes to bits goa, many people prefer it over pilani because its goa lol, anyways i just wanted to know your expectations v/s reality at BITS Goa for future aspirants coz many live in the bubble "beach pe coding krunga".

Well technically, if you were to, you could code on a beach. For me the life here was almost at par with my expectations, have had 15+ beach visits and 30+ outings in sem 1 alone (though CG got fuked in all this)

Its not a well placed campus, Hyd looks better, the girl to boy ratio is horrible but you have cheap ass alcohol, so drowning all your problems away is an option that's easy on your wallet

Idk what your expectations are but then it's not as competitive as ppl think it is , ppl here are laid back (not everyone but on an average) and the summer weather is just too hot and sweaty , plus we don't have power back up but other two campuses do. not only this but the travelling costs are high when you have to go outside. All these are negatives but lemme say this I personally think I made good descision coming here cuz physics dept here is amazing , i really enjoyed my time in the 1-2 clubs here and I think they are much better than the equivalent from other two campuses( Extra curricular work here is more ).
