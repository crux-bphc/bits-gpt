# I'm planning on doing MBA from BITS. But the program isn't well known, would it be a wise decision?

I'm in my final year of BTech and am planning on doing MBA, I fucked up in my CAT exam, and BITS MBA exam is still left. Although BITS has excellent reputation on engineering does it reflect on their MBA program as well, like in case of some IITs? Some people on Quora didn't think it was good enough. Ig the best reviews would come from BITSians themselves. Kindly help.
