I am a 1st year student at bits Hyderabad.I currently have an NC in meow, I didnot write the exam due to personal problems and I didnot apply for a makeup.I couldn't register for my courses in second semester. What to do now? When I asked an augsd representative he said that I can repeat the course in my second year. Is this true? Can anybody tell me what I should do? Can anyone explain me acb?

You can't repeat courses in 1st year.

Why would a augsd guy lie? Why are you asking here on reddit whether it's true?

[ Combo of Es (2 or more ) + NC (1 or more) ] will result into ACB citing your CG fall below 4.5 along given criteriaâ€™s .
