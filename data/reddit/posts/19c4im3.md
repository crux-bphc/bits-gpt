# Some Important Questions I have as a Sophomore
## u/Spirited-Muscle188 (Score: 14) (Flair: Career)
Hopefully, a senior or an alum can answer them:

1. What sort of internships do dualites do after their 3rd Year? Are they research internships at IITs/NITs/IIMs? What sort of pre-reqs or LoRs are necessary for the same?
2. What all projects are encompassed in the ones recommended before an SI? Are the projects within academic enough or what is the usual practice followed by folks who've landed an SI?
3. Considering I do an SI, what sort of off-campus thesis opportunities are available for me considering either of my 5-1 or 5-2 will be the thesis sem?

1) I doubt if most dualites do an internship after 3-2. Regardless of degree, you'll find people doing a remote RI at foreign institutes. I think that it usually requires a large amount of cold mailing.  


2) Most people I know only had course projects/assignments on their resume (OOP/DBS/DSA, and a very small minority had done computer graphics). Academic projects are differentiated and better than course projects IMO. An internship, academic or not, has greater value than just projects though.  


3) NUS is the most common institute for off campus thesis from what I have seen. If you do an SI, you would probably have to go for a 5-1 thesis without any choice, since SI clashes with 5-1 PS. Also, the situation might improve by your time, but currently, getting an approval for off campus thesis from the CSIS HoD is very difficult.

1. Nothing after 3rd year, at-least on campus. If you're interested you should try for different industrial/research internships, there are tons of opportunities and you should apply to many. Especially in research, it isn't as hard as you might think to get an RI at a good university abroad.
2. Course projects are enough for CS ppl. Some companies who came for ML roles needed an ML profile, but these are day 2 companies (who had a very weird selection criteria).
3. 5-1 would be your thesis sem. There are *some* problems for doing off-campus thesis in CS from Pilani so you might be better off doing one in your dual. Applications are through (hundreds of) cold mails.
