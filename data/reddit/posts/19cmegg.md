Here it says that one can stay off campus if parents are residents of Pilani, does this apply for Hyd and Goa too?

I would ask why would you wanna stay home? You’d be missing half the point being in college, might seem silly but you’ll understand when you do.

Does it mean you can stay off campus? I think it's more like you have a pass that you can leave every Saturday and come back on Sunday. I don't think they allow you to live outside campus.

Goan here. You have to stay on campus. The “day scholar pass” is only for weekends and institute holidays.

Nope, I don't think you'll be granted permission unless you're missing a limb or smth lol   
Also, hyderabad and goa campuses are not like pilani, and there's absolutely no chance that you'll be living close enough to make the commute everyday.  
But if your parents live in hyd then you can literally go home whenever the fuck you want, just issue an outstation and cut. I know locals who literally just come to campus for quizzes and exams.  
You'd still have to pay the hostel fees tho. And mess grace can only be availed for 5 days a month.

Dubai campus always had day scholars.
