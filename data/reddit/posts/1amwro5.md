Basically the title. I don’t mind paying the hostel fees but I don’t want to live there.

1 in a 1000 literally, there will be no precedent and admin helping is a dream. Also, fucking give bitsat first

Its pretty easy to get a room outside campus in pilani. You can stay out in local all day, you just need to be back by the gate closing time. This works if you are partying all day and want a safe space. I dont know of any other ways to live off campus without admin being a pain.

Yeah it's pretty easy - but you will have to be back before the gate closes.

Yes, I know day scholars at Pilani campus. Just need to inform the SWD at the time of admission or later that you don't need hostel.

why? living in hostels gets much less credit than it should, you'll realise it's so much more fun when you talk to your friends living in DU living in PGs who haven't bonded nearly as well with their peers as we get to
