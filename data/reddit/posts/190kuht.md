Reservation based on caste in 21st century is the shittiest thing taking country down. Reservation should now be based on  family's low financial conditions. And for people you are actually being discriminated.

Your branches dont really matter, even colleges dont really matter beyond a point. 

Other aspects such as networking, playing it smart, and most importantly luck matter the most

Reservations in neet/jee or any other exam/job etc should be removed. It's 2024 grow the fuck up. I got 602 in neet and my friend who had an SC certificate got 480. He got GMC but I didn't.

1&gt; All those who say, that Goa has harder academics than any other campus have a very massive skill issue. It takes barely any effort to get B, that being said, Getting A- and A in BPGC is next to fucking impossible and requires as much prep as did JEE adv.

2&gt; If you chose BPHC over BPGC, u sir are a psychopath since both campuses are the same the same except one is in Goa right next to a town and the other is in the middle of nowhere.

All the bits campuses don't stand anywhere near top 7 iits. They can only be compared with 2nd gen iits, for same branch ( upto ropar). Agree or argue with the wall.
