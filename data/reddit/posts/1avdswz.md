It depends a lot on your batch. For reference I'm a second year in hyd rn and to get a 50% scholarship I had to have a 9+,but the new batch has a much lower cut off.

It's completely dependent on the strengths of the individual,well I am not the correct person to help u out(barely got 8cg lol) but i know a few 9.8+ guys,all of them were well versed with pcm subjects(thanks to JEE prep) and hence didn't study much through the sem,just an all nighter or two before the exams and that did the job for them,while others had to grind everyday since they weren't that comfortable with chem and meow(especially the latter had insane bump in average this year)
