# Placements of 2023 grads
## u/levitatingthrough (Score: 2) (Flair: Future BITSian)
I am considering to join BITS this year (Pilani or Goa). I came across some videos which said the placements have dropped in last 1-2 years and that there are many unplaced 4thies. Is it true? even for Pilani?

It's even true for IITs too, life is so unpredictable we never know if the course you're doing will still be relevant after 4 years, so choose wisely and look into future and choose best course and best college for yourself

I guess itâ€™s a pretty bad time for all grads, not just from BITS.

Just so you know. Up until the market crashed, placements weren't declining but getting better.
