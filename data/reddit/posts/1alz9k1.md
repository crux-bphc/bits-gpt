Well we all know what's happening with the zero attendance policy in BITS (not explaining here for obvious reasons).
BITS is known for its attendance policy, and here we are...

Let's do something collectively... What's happening now shouldn't continue... It's kill the legacy of bits pilani (the bio dept is specially to be blamed)

Are you talking about 1st year bio in Hyd campus?

If so, I can provide context for others. Bio department is taking newly introduced exit tests way too seriously. They have made their own app which is very difficult to cheat. They also map with biometric attendence so we cant write from room. They also introduced gps location tracking (but i heard it has been removed, I am in another group).

I guess this post is talking about this and exit tests in general which have been introduced to lectures of 1st years.

These faculty just to see some crowd in class assign as high as 20% weightage to attendance. 
Some have even declared that they would take attendance on any random day and allot all 10% of marks just for that 1 day of attendance.

What's happening? I'm in pilani and I have no idea what you're talking about. Bio dept hasn't imposed any attendance requirement either, other than the occasional tut tests which most branches have

A 21 batch bio dualite here. First of all, the no attendance policy only allows you to attend the compres without having to attend any% classes. Next, every professor is given the liberty to decide the course structure, and they do have the right to include marks for attendance as well. I'm not a ghot(barely a 7 pointer), and I hated this too until I just realised that it was just my ego that hated it and apparently going to classes and getting free marks is a good way to boost your cg. It gives you a routine and prepares you for the Midsems and endsems, so that all nighters don't become the last option. Just letting you know.
