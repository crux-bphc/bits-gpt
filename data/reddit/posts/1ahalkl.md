My math sucks rn, phy and chem is doable but what text should I solve math from? I am not able to solve JEE Mains PYQs directly, I'm finding them pretty difficult. Any book that's at bitsat level and also like a stepping stone to understanding Mains PYQs better?

My question is, if it is possible to get BITS if I Start Preparing Now and what are the Requirements for getting into BITS. And also how do I Start my preparation.

where do people get bitsat pyqs? is it only through the test series like mathongo, or is there a place from where you can directly just solve pyq questions

Is it true that they are going to change the 0 attendance policy. Are they removing it completely
