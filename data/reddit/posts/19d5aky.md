Context: Didn't apply for any clubs in 1st sem(yes I was a delulu fresher). 2nd sem applied for a bunch of clubs n got rejected (L op skill issue). Also I'm like a person with a very small social battery. I've started to go to lectures, but I feel too awkward to strike up a convo with a person sitting next to me. Had a nice cry session and came to my senses, and thought of asking reddit. But srsly I never thought I'd be one of those ppl who'd ask online how to make friends smh

Yeah so im looking for advice. N if any of yall wanna be my friend or just talk about anything, feel free to dm me.

You can start with branching out to your wingies first, cause they're supposed to be people who you literally share a toilet with. 

A nice hack to break the ice is to ask questions. Maybe academic questions and time commitment in club-related questions ought to help you start a conversation. Most people are quite nice and would never shrug off someone who has a question and is also polite. This may be a bit outside your comfort zone but you gotta try doing this.

You can also start with this. Just ask for a pen, or a pencil for starters, maybe confirm what the prof said. This is not supposed to be difficult, remember this. You don't owe anybody anything, you're just looking for a conversation to begin with.

This was me in first year (2010-2011)

Got active online, started making friends from all over the world. Also started exploring my interests a lot. That lead to joining as founding member of newly made RC Club at Pilani. Started making friends from that as it got popular.

Started participating in wing birthdays, regional assoc stuff, any and every event that came up. Eventually, people start recognizing you on campus.

Not everyone is adept at making friends IRL. Find your niche of curiosities and there will be others who would have the same things they're interested in.

You haven't mentioned your wing so I'm assuming you don't connect with the people living around you in any way.

Clubs are just one of many ways you can find common interests in the college. Others include Assocs, Departments and Random Interactions.

Most of my first year friends were from my Assoc , Others were wingies that are still wingies 5 years later. Others I found because I liked to play sports. Some found me interesting enough to chat in classes , some left after they found me boring after the initial interactions.

Try to be a fun person to be around , You need common ground to connect with people , so explore your hobbies.
And don't fret about the same right now , I didn't even know half my wing till late 1-2.

Keep doing what you think is fun , people will come.along. :)

P.S : A quick look at your comment history tells me You are a Chem dualite. Start making chem friends asap in 2-1 , You guys will need all hands on deck to make it through the shit storm that is Chemistry.

My man, chill out, just talk to people living beside you in your hostel, maybe go play some sport you used to, go to your cultural association, things will be way better.

Also, by any chance do I know you, because I think I do.

There is no relation in joining clubs and making friends . The only thing is that how u communicate with people or make them feel more interested in you . Talk soft straight to the point no bakwas

uhm, Start doing a lil bit of everything
For the clubs, phone your seniors and request once and assure then you'll learn on the way I'm pretty sure they'll let you in
And strike a convo nonetheless, pata hai mushkil hai lekin trust me if even one person got thr spark of interest in you, you'll automatically get adopted by some group

If none works, kuch mahine ruk ja if I made it there merese dosti karle

Do you play valorant/pubg/codm/gta5 or something else? I am not in bits, but I can hook you up with some of my friends, although timings would clash a lot, as we guyz play when we are all together physically.  


Anyways you can hit me up, I had been in that stage and its very painful to say the least. I am online 24 hrs and you can strike a convo with me on any topic any time I dont judge at all even if its kinda illegal and all, and once you start a topic I wont end a conversation unless you want, I love deep chats.  


And for anyone who thinks I am a pervert, no dude and get a life, I am a guy and would love to help this person out be it a male/female or transgender, only requirement is that the person belongs to homo sapiens.
