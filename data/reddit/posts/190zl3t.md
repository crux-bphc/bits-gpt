# Is our batch the ghottest of them all or are they throwing cg this year?

CG list just dropped, the average cg is 7.23 for firsties, 7.43 for dullas. Is this normal for 1-1? Are they increasing leniency this year with their grading? Because if they are it doesnt feel like it ðŸ˜”.  This isnt a cope post, im genuinely curious.

I'm a thirdie at Goa and I can confirm that grading was very lenient this sem in comparison to the last two years. The phoenix department especially seems to have tried to give out really good grades.

being good at JEE like courses, and being ghot in general is different, wait for next sem sg
