I am currently pursuing BSMS Physics from NIT AGARTALA. Does my 4year BS degree is eligible to apply for Mtech program (aerospace) and Which GATE subject should i give aerospace/physics. Please clear my doubt.

Please note:
- BITS Master's admission process is also done through BITSHD exam.
- MTech is in WILP. On campus programs are ME.
- There are no aerospace or physics Master's in any of the BITS campuses (the MSc Physics degree is for undergrads only).

You'd need to do more research about admission requirements and programs offered at various places. Most websites have eligibility requirements mentioned.
