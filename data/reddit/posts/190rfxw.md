**Not a Joke post**
I am in second year and want to date. Whomever I have asked to date me, have told me that they are in a relationship. This makes me just very upset and makes me think that I am just not good enough. 
So, I request any female who is interested in dating. Please contact me.  ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡

Desperation is probably the biggest red flag brother.

How are your looks on a scale of 1 to 10?
(Just asking casually, not interested in dating so don't bother me.)

I hope you find love but I just hope you don't end up falling in a one sided thing where you prioritize the other person while you are just a friend to them. It would cause too much pain for you to go back to that state in your mind and not crave for that person and behave casually with them. Assuming you have innocent intentions and true passion in your heart just make sure you are giving it to the right person to not end up with a broken heart
