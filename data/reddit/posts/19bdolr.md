I currently do not have a CG that would make me eligible for a finance minor and despite of that i will be finishing all of the 6 offshoot courses by 4-1 (Bio dualite and i would be taking a summer term) .
I want to know :
1. Would not having a minor degree despite of completing all the required courses be an issue during PS2 or would i be at the same preference if I have an offshoot
2. How do i take my courses(what courses to take in summer term and what to take in 4-1)

Depends on the campus about the “reverse minor” situation, Goa campus has discontinued it. Not sure about the other campuses.
Coming to your questions:

1. I don’t think as such it shouldn’t matter too much if you don’t have an official minor degree, given you have done the courses separately, but I am not really sure. Very tricky. Like no one properly understands the PS algorithm and how much weight is given to each parameter for each role and each company. I have friends who did not complete the minor per say but are in JPMC and I have friends who had amazing offshoots but did not get. So very tricky and unpredictable.

2. For course planning this is what I did and would suggest:
FoFA in 3-2
DRM, SAPM, FinMan in Summer Term
BAAV in 4-1

It’s best to do BAAV last because it requires some concepts of SAPM and FinMan (also FuFA). Moreover you need to complete your courses before 4-1 for it to count for 5-1 PS.

Edit: Haven’t done FRAM but i would suggest you to do it at the end only, with BAAV.
