# Whenever I notice someone has left their electronics on the table at the library, I pocket it and take it home so that it does not get stolen. What acts of kindness do you do for strangers on campus?

These days I also make sure to answer my phone calls on speaker with the phone held out in front of me so people around me donâ€™t have to hear an annoying one-sided conversation.

Well, I once saw this kind stranger helping others with their electronic gadgets. He offered to help me carry mine, too, but never gave it back to me ðŸ˜ž

That's great of you, OP! Lol wish ppl did the phone thing more if they're gonna be on long calls..Â  You can also give the gadgets at the front desk and put up a picture on the group (if there's several other ppl around who might misinterpret itðŸ˜…)

Only until the actual owner catches you in the act and assume otherwise. In a moment your act of kindness can turn into an act of theft. Be aware about that.
