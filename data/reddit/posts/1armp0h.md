I’m an undergraduate student at the Dubai Campus. I’m not qualified to answer most of these questions but I’ll spill what I know (completely in the context of UG) 

1) They never release “official” placement stats for any of their programs. For UG CS it’s approx 5/6AED PM. 

2) PwC, Reckitt, MSD, Siemens, Emirates, Sharaf DG and the likes for undergraduate. Not exactly sure if there’s even concept of “placement” for post grad. But since these companies already come year on year I’m sure you can approach them fairly easily. 

3) The top companies here for UG pay about 7/8K PM. The best one is PWC with 10K PM. 

4) Yes, PPOs are offered quite a bit here. A good number of the UG students end up working for the same company as their PS2 station. 

5) Unsure. 

How about you shoot me a DM and I can connect you with a post grad student at BPDC. All my answers were purely on the context of UG studies. I hope it gave you an idea. But at the end of the day I have a simple logic, if if I’m going to spend 1/2Years on masters and X amount of money it must be in a top 5 world ranked university, otherwise I simply don’t find the ROI. That’s my 2 cents. Cheers and good luck!
