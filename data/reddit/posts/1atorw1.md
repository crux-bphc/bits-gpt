# Declining friend circle
## u/Due_Temperature3471 (Score: 46) (Flair: Social Life: Goa)
I am a fourth year dualite in Goa. I made a few friends in my second year. But they too have made deeper friendships with others. As such my interaction with them is limited now. Plus my batchmates and juniors are not that interactive.

 Whenever fest is held I am all alone. Some of them don't want me in their dance circle. What to do?

Do dual students need to make friends with juniors?

Fests hi khatam hogaye bhai ab kya hi farak padta hai, everything is gonna change in a few months for not just you but everyone in your friend group. It'll be a miracle if even half those friendships survive lol. Learn how to make friends, it's a useful trait in life. I find it easy to talk to people with common interests, so you could pursue like a hobby or a passion of yours and you'll definitely meet people there. Also, learn to put efforts into relationships, it's always appreciated if the other person is genuine.
Remember, better times are always ahead!

Since you're a 4thie you just have an year left in campus. Imo just focus on your growth and maybe pickup some hobbies for one year. When you move to a new place put this experience behind you and make an effort to make as many friends as possible. If you meet a lot of people atleast a few will stick. 

Making friends in college is a matter of doing the right things at the right time. Idk how you can make friends as a 4thie so sorry I can't help with that.

Just remember not having enough friends really isn't a personal failing (I'm sure some retards will suggest that here.) Feel sorry for yourself for a while  (just a tiny little bit of time) for not being able to have the college life you envisioned and move on. People say this is the best time of your life but I can assure you I know a lot of people who've had the most fun and friends in life after getting their first job. 

As for making friends you could make a list of things you'd like to do and ask a bunch of people you're friendly with  if they'd like to join you. Once you hang out maybe they'll take initiative and call you next time and even if they don't you'll have crossed something of your bucket list

Things will get better. You can always start afresh in a new place.

Concentre on your career read all kind of books you don't need friend and relationship engineering is very tough

Maybe try helping juniors with their work, they could end up being your friends.
