# Depression and loneliness
## u/Due_Temperature3471 (Score: 25) (Flair: Academics)
I am a fourth year Economics + Chemical Engineering Dualite at Goa campus. My Economics offshoot score is low. I am just sick and tired of the daily routine here. Plus my friends are rarely available to talk to me. I feel I am on the route to entering early level depression. This is my last sem on campus. Yet I could not go on many outings compared to other people. I could not enjoy my college life. I feel stressed out about my future as I want to go into core sector industry, preferably economics/finance. 

Can someone suggest what to do?

Ps lag jaega aur phir naukri, itna tension mat le. Especially, since you can't do anything else about it.

Economics Offshoot doesnâ€™t matter for M.Sc. Econ students. Finance offshoot is for other branches. Your CG will be the only thing that matters for PS2.

Try visiting emergency of any nearby hospital for 4 hrs. Share what you feel here after that. For the sake of experiment only. Just try for once
