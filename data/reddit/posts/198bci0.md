itna cringe, why?

He became such a sellout, making fun of your own alma mater to advertise a "college" that charges you 50 lakhs for an unregistered DU degree in business and a campus which is literally an office building.

Banda ne bits\*t crack kiya hai (EEE that too) and he's learning probability formula from some rich kid who paid his way into a college that's not even giving out a degree or even a diplomaðŸ’€ I can't even imagine how much they're paying him

matlab thoda sa self respect? chee bhai

Somrat Datta bhi is bakchodi kiya tha, watch this: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cmheZQ6iGz0](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cmheZQ6iGz0)

At least the ishan sharma one is fine, ye kya hai bhai? kuch bhi? talent is going down, bits is not worth it so newton school chale jao? Sharam nhi aati hai kya in logon ko? some poor kid in the comment section is wondering if he should take a drop year after getting eee at bits because of his video. Do you not have a sense of morality?? paise ke liye kuch bhi bol dega?

mods, this is not hate speech. It's criticism, pls don't delete it. It's super pissing off to see youtubers pull this shameless shit, and I want more people to know about this because there are some genuinely  good people who are youtubers too. you know what they did was wrong, for the love of god pls don't delete the post

bhai my blood boils everytime I see the somrat datta video, like pata hai fees is very high but do you have to say fake shit and defame your own college like this in public? all that to get some money from newton school? it's not even subtle, this is NOT bitsian culture.

if talent were to be judged by cutoffs and course avg, 23 batch definitely isn't talentless

Somrat Dutta himself barely managed to get MSc Bio at BITS. He is the last guy to be talking about talent. Arsehole

A bit unrelated but what do you guys feel about Ishan Sharma's content?

Edit : I should make it clear as a bits alumini or bits dropout.
