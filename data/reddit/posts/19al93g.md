I was thinking of buying a toaster for the hostel room, are there any specific energy requirements that I will have to keep in mind?

Please feel free to recommend a budget friendly toaster.

Just keep the max wattage/current in check

People here keep big ass heaters and they sometimes trip the MCBs. Don't think a toaster will do anything.
