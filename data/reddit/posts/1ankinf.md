[Changed classroom participation component mid semester to force us to attend classes. Classes were practically empty before this.](https://preview.redd.it/6h86z745eshc1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8754fff518cbc8f94e7ad8615b8770daa413188)

Christ man just attend the tut once a week, Meow is the one course you should attend the tuts for anyway, it would help you.

2nd year we have surprise quizzes for Microeconomics and Macroeconomics during lecture hours itself, you havent seen anything yet

" Bio-metric attendance system for the classes (both tutorial and theory) are not working properly for many students for the course PHY F111 (MEOW) ".   
Do they really expect us to believe this reason?  
"Attendance stopped working for this course in particular"

It's literally MeOW. Attend the tuts, that's it. How will you all survive in 2nd/3rd year when the course size becomes smaller and professors more sadistic lol.
