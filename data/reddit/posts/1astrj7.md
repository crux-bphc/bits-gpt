# Thoughts about SORA by OpenAI?

For those out of loop, its a new AI tool made by the masterminds at OpenAI which allows you to make   
hyper-realistic videos through text prompts and the results it has put out are fascinating. 

  
Felt that topics like these are worth discussing here, given that we are an 'institute of technology' after all, and this is going to affect all our careers directly or indirectly, positively or negatively. Would like to know your opinions on it - pros/cons, predictions and ideas on development from here on, use cases, etc.

  
Providing some links for you to take a look -

“AI will only replace the boring jobs.”

SORA and DALL.E: Well well (artists, cinematographers, video editors, etc. crying in the corner)

Seriously at this point, if OpenAI comes up with a tool a few years down the road that can start working on complex research problems then 7Tr is no joke.

It will affect everybody rich positively and everybody poor negatively . If government doesn't care middle class will die within 15 years

As an editor POV I think it can help greatly. Sometimes we req specific stock videos that are mostly scattered on different websites like storyblocks, videohives, envato, etc. If we get a service  whose  single subscription can generate every kind of stock footage it will help saving time and efforts.  

Also, we can experiment many stuff. Sometimes we want to experiment something but we can't shoot those things on our own.

But can it really edit photo? Well for now it just can make a video of text 
So why would editors be effected
