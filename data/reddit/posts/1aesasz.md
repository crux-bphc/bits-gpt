Hey, currently in 12th grade and yeah..JEE didn't go great and in whatever time that's left wm I think this year I'm better off focusing on BITS, bcs apart from other govn institutes this one holds the reputation of being one of the best. But it's also quite costly.. so I just wanna know the stats of people studying here that did actually take a student loan or some scholarships. Like are y'all basically just rich and that's why you got into the college or did you have to get a loan or what. 

Ik I should be worrying about all this if I actually do crack the exam but..yeah I'm still a kid with not that good of a financial background (student loan ke bina 1/2 bhi nhi de paunga)...

Ofc we all aren't rich bro , many students have taken student loan . Plus if your parent's combined income is less than 13lpa then u can also get Merit cum need scholarship which u can avail to get fees waiver depending on your Cgpa . As far as I remember a cgpa of as minimum as 6 can also provide a fee wavier of 25%.
So yeah , it may actually sound a lot of money but the scholarship and student loan system makes it easy for middle class folks to take admission in BITS.

Best of luck üëç

Considering IIT fees are about 60% of BITS you'll have to take loan there also. But good thing about such prestigious institutes is that you can get 50lakh loan without collateral at a low interest just on the basis of admission(BITS and IITs). So study hard, jee is not over, it is as far as BITSAT
