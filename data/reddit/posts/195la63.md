MnC is quite a good introduction to bits. Finally an applied mathematics degree, will help people who want to do a job in computing and also for others who wish to pursue a masters in applied maths. Hopefully they donâ€™t butcher the curriculum.

I think dual degree cutoffs will rise even more now since people have another top notch branch to fall back on if they fail to get cs

In fact mnc may even be more desirable than cs in some cases

IDK about MNC cutoffs but can we expect lower the cutoffs for phoenix branches?

any idea of what the cutoff for this could be in this year's BITSAT

Soooo how many more seats can we expect this year? 
ig around 240-300

Also Iâ€™m assuming the cutoffs for MnC would be almost at par with ECE maybe higher

So will this year cutoff for lower branches decrease as no of seats have increased?
