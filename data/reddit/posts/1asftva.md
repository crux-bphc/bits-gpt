" BITSIANS GUIDENCE "

Bitsians

Desperately need guidence for BITS 2024, I know basics of 11th and 12th ... I'm dropper didn't do well in JEE mains. Parents said that they will send me to vit vellore if I don't crack any of the competitive exams but I want to try my best to get admission into a college on my own yk it's better late then never, please suggest me how should I prepare for BITS, should I complete the arihant book along with NCERT? I think I need to clear my concepts too... should I watch full length lectures or one shots or should I directly study from a book....are the notes give in the arihant guide good? Embibe or Mathongo for mocks? How many mocks?
I am ready to study day and night, I gathered the courage to post this in a public platform because I need a mentor. Please guide me!
Please answer asap, it's a request I'll forever be thankful.  

Edit - I forgot to add that I tried to solve some of the pyqs and surprisingly I was able to solve a couple of them... I know it's not that great üòÖ

Oneshot for maths and chemistry other than bounceback oriented towards bitsat level

I passed my class 12 board exam last year (2023) with less than 75% marks, but at that time I did not know about BITSAT exam. Now after knowing about BITSAT I am re-attempting my class 12 board exam this year (2024) like a regular student in all subjects, so after the result is declared my class 12 passing year will be 2024, So if I take a drop for preparation then will I be eligible for BITSAT next year also (I have not attempted BITSAT this year yet, 2024 will be my first BITSAT attempt as a class 12 student)

How does the dual degrees work in BITS? Like how is the cutoff and what masters and bachelors options do we get?
