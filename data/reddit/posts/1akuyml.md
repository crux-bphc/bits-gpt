# Options for Research PS 1

What can be some good Research Station options for PS 1 at a cg of 9.1, if I'm interested in Core Econ (public policy and macro analysis) or a role which involves using ML ?

And should I prefer onsite over online, if I'm actually wanting to learn something.

Also, what locations should I prefer for onsite, keeping finances in mind ?

ICRIER or IIPA for economics, I think both are onsite. CG cutoff is very low and iirc it is unpaid. Still a better option would be taking up an ML role in some IT company.
