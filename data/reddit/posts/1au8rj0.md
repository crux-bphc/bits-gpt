Can any of the seniors kindly get the curriculum for B.E. Maths and Computing from administration please ? This is important for international candidates whose admissions are happening right now for 2024. We have to give our preferences.

Alumni here. Had asked about this for my younger sibling and got this reply. Looked like a standard template response. Havenâ€™t checked the site again but judging by the comments, there is still no update I think.

For curriculum ig it would be the same as that of IITs

And regarding the cutoff this branch may lie between cse and ece (just like other colleges trend)

What effect would this cause for dual students in first year?
