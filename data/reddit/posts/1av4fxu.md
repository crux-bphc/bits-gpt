# Which sem for EEE core placements?
## u/VeterinarianFlaky189 (Score: 14) (Flair: Career)
I am a 3rd yearite in EEE @hyd. I want to pursue Electronics as my career. I want to work for 1-2 years before going for Masters. My CGPA is 7.15 (till 3-1)

1) Going for PS2 in 4-1 (and then trying for a PPO) and sitting in placements for 4-2.

2) Going for Placements in 4-1, given that I can pull my CGPA up to 7.4-7.5 by studying hard in 3-2, and then PS2 in 4-2.

Which option is better for me and how's the placement scenario for electronics in both the semesters? ( no.of companies, offers, and PPO conversion etc.)

Placement is generally much better in 4-1 in comparison to 4-2 for core elec (I think it is close to non-existent in 4-2). But I am not sure if you would cross the CG cutoff in 4-1. I guess it is 7.5 for most companies but not sure. Best to consult with people on campus.
