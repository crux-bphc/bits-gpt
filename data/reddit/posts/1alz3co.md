# Are there any scholarships available to students who have only one parent?

Hi all , wanted to know if BITS gives any scholarship or fee reduction for children of single parents.

My father passed away when i was 2 years old and my mother has been the one bearing the fees for my sister and my education since then. Her income is above the MCN threshold ,but the city we live in has a high cost of living as well.   
I wasn't sure if BITS had anything for single parents and hence didn't apply for MCN in the first semester.

If there isn't any such thing in BITS , but you know of any outside scholarships for education please do tell.

Thank you all

The MCN limit was revised to 15LPA in Pilani. See if the new limit is of any help.

Rest you can go down to SWD and talk to the dean or someone, they may help.
