So I gave my mains and expecting 133 marks, now I am focusing primarily on BITS. Now im considering if im getting Chemical Engineering in any campus then imma take it. I wanted to know how hectic the curriculum is and whether I would be able to manage time for coding and extra curriculars and how difficult is it for a Chemical major to be placed in CS domains.

Any advice is highly appreciated...


Edit: how hard is it to get 8+ CGPA on top of coding and extra-curriculars?
Edit 2: How hard is chemical engineering ?

I would say first focus on getting in, then think about all these stuff. It's easier said than done.

target 230+ for chemical Hyderabad.
yes, many people get placed in IT field from chemE but afaik it's tough.

also target mains rn, next attempt hai, 97+ le aa, kisi decent NIT me chemE mil jayega.

curriculum ka idk

From what I've heard from seniors, chemical (atleast in Pilani) has lite grading and you'll have lots of free time as well. Only downside is that chemical dept has random lecture quizzes, where you have to be present in that lecture to attempt the quiz. Something like 45-50 marks (out of 300 course total) is of lecture quizzes so you are kinda forced to attend lectures for A/A-

Afaik, no other dept has this policy in Pilani campus, could be wrong

Chemical 3rdie here, the coursework is not that hard, the branch however has too much internal competition(Or saanps), much less unity than Mech or Phoenix branches. 
Getting an 8+ SGPA is p straightfwd, don't miss classes, be diligent in them and go to every tutorial(There are surprise tests at 8 AM)
Grading in chemical isn't the best, neither the worst
Managing extra curricular or Minor degrees while having chemical as your main degree is on the easier side, in general it is easy to manage extra curriculars 
If you have any particular doubts, feel free to ping me

why not go for a dual

Chemical as a branch is relatively less demanding than circuital options out there. Contrary to what you may think, it definitely involves a lot of math and physics in addition to chemistry. So, if you are thinking of taking up ChemE just because you like Chemistry, don't let it become the basis for your decision. Courses like Fluid Mechanics and Mass Transfer Operations are heavily math-based, it helps if you pay extra attention in your calculus lectures.

Like I said, the branch itself has relatively light coursework and you wouldn't need to break a sweat studying for exams. The department itself has a lenient grading policy. I wouldn't call it the best (definitely nowhere near the Humanities Department yet), but good enough to get you an 8+ CG provided you put in the effort. I cannot say the same for my Phoenix brethren.

It isn't very hard to balance coding and coursework. That being said, don't assume that getting an A/A- is a walk in the park. I was initially interested in solely pursuing ML/DL, but when I really started hitting my stride is when I started to take interest in the core Chemical Engineering topics.

Look 133 isn't bad marks and you can definitely improve in your second attempt. I went from 100 to 180 between the two shifts and got a +5% percentile boost. But if you are really focused only on BITS , I think you have to learn some chapters that were omitted from the syllabus for mains. Plan accordingly

Need some insight about what is taught in chemical engineering and how does it compare to branches like Mechanical,Civil etc...
