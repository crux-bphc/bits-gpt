# Exit tests are a joke

I attended all PnS classes until today, but I was forced to miss today's class because I was unwell. The professor decided to conduct a test today.

Apparently, there are only 5 tests for the entire semester, and today was the 3rd one. I won't get full marks even if I attend all remaining classes.

Exit tests got students running around tryna gain marks while missing the whole point of classes which is: learning

same with me, I had to go home due to a family emergency and I went to every damn M2 class, and the day I took the holiday she took the test. We should talk to the dean about having best out 3-4 out of 5 tests, as its unfair for genuine cases.

one of these days, someone is gonna force himself to go to a class despite being extremely unwell... like it makes more sense to keep taking attendance every class so that even if we miss 2-3, it doesn't make much of a difference in the long run

if you're confident u can do well without classes, skip them, u can probably do well w/o them. (source: have good cg without classes)
