# PS-2 options for IT role at my cg
## u/flashstorm9 (Score: 10) (Flair: Career)
Hello, have a cg of 7.463 at the end of 3-1 (2021AA). Was wondering if I could actually get a decent IT PS at this cg considering I go for 4-1 PS. Nothing extravagant to show for my in cv as of now but I can do a range of courses this semester if necessary.A ps that could possibly offer a 13-18 lpa PPO is what I would like.

why don't you check the PS2 cutoffs prepared unofficially sheet? 7.4 can land up good IT PS.
