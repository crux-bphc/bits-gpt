# Will I be able to cope as a foreign student in BITS?

Those of you who have got into BITS by passing the entrance exam must have worked extremely hard for it and are probably very smart. I’m a foreign student here so I can apply with my SAT marks and it’s much much easier for me to get in.

While getting admission is not a problem, I really don’t know if I’ll be able to cope up in college while studying beside students that have studied much harder to get to where I am. Do you think I will have trouble with the course (CS btw) and will I be able to cope?

There are kids who got in through SAT and have stellar gpas and good extra-curriculars and there are guys who got in through bitsat and have neither of those. College is a different ball game altogether. No one can predict or expect anything. Think of it as a blank slate. This is a fresh start. Utilize it to its fullest.

In the first year, all foundation courses will bbe Taught. Meaning academically you are all equal. Besides that, socially nothing changes. You will get some snobs who think they are better because they wrote through bitsat but that is very rare and besides getting the same position through much less efforts is a sign of intelligence
