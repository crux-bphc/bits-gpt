But is bits law school any good. Better than nlus? (I am in a dilemma choosing between these two)? How is the general camps life. Are rules and regulations strict? If someone’s already in bits law school can they dm me.

it just opened up last year and dosen't have a campus yet. The temporary campus is in mumbai till the official one opens up in Kalyan. Apparently it's set up very well but you can't say anything yet since there is literally just one batch of 120 students in their first year. The campus and dorms are more equipped than any other law school though, they have housekeeping and laundry, and i think they require you to stay on campus
