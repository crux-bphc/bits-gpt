What is a good offshoot score for finance PS? And the non-tech opportunities in BITS Pilani.. Also should one pursue MBA right after the btech?

Good offshoot- anything above 42/43 is good enough for a decent one.
Although if you just want one - then even 38-40 is fine.

Many people do pursue MBA right after btech, it is just a matter of where you want to see yourself ahead as will definitely open up opportunities going ahead but you need to be aware that MBA isn't what it used to be years ago.
