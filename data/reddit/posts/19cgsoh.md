I am dedicating enough time to acads this sem and hopefully I'll do better than in 1-1. Just thought the above knowledge might motivate me. 
I don't prefer asking such questions on an anonymous forum, but seniors are either clueless or laugh in my face. Can't really blame them :-|

Go to swd, they post the list of people and their cg, with what % scholarship they got, it might still be on the notice boards

For 100 percent it's around 9.6 plus and for 40 it's around 9.4+.

Is the scholarship for 3-1 provided on the basis of cgpa obtained in 2-1 or 2-2 ? What about the scholarship for PS1?
