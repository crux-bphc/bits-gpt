Just curious, why do people call McD as MacD? I've seen many people do this, any particular reason?

You can order from Burger King or McDonalds using swiggy, the delivery system has gotten pretty good in the last year or so and a lot of the restaurants in/near sainikpuri (a locality \~10km away, which has a lot of cafes and restaurants) have started delivering to campus. Also, we have had a lot of new outlets open as well post covid, overall food scene in hyd is pretty good.
