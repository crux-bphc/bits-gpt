# Non-CS seniors/alumni who went into IT/finance field, how did you deal with the fact that you were learning something you would never use?

Majority of non-cs students go into IT/fin. Most of 2nd and 3rd year are spent learning stuff which will never be used. Is the motivation to do well only CGPA? That feels extremely dull. I kind of regret not choosing msc eco instead of phoenix even though the cutoffs are higher for my branch. I got 9+ CG but I am still sad.

You can take comfort in knowing that even the CS people only really use maybe 4 or 5 of the courses that they are taking in their actual job too. 
(And as a Phoenix student you actually share 2 of these 5 useful courses)

Regardless of your major, 90% of what you study may not end up helping you in your job at all. (No matter what your job is)

That is because the aim of college courses isnâ€™t to prepare you for whatever the latest fad in the job market is. It is to provide you a well-rounded fundamental understanding of all the various topics of your engineering major.
