# Need information regarding analytics
## u/Interesting_Job168 (Score: 7) (Flair: Career)
I want to know about the field of analytics. I am not sure about how to start and what to do. From what I have read, I can discern three paths in analytics: data scientist, Data analyst, and Data engineer. I am not sure if this categorization is true or not so I am asking for advice regarding what to do and it would be really helpful if someone could provide a roadmap.
