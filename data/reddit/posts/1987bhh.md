Hi. I am thinking of building an ant colony simulation, inspired by biology of ants' interactions. I am not very clear on the details of how I am going to build it yet.i have a general sense of where I want to go with it. An interest in doing some research on this and implementing and building cool algorithms is what I think, is required. If any one wants in on this coding adventure, DM. 

PS: I am looking to improve my coding skills and overall having a fun time so the best coding skills aren't really the most needed thing. (Plus we have chat gpt and YouTube , so we will figure that part out) Awesome ideas and a keen interest would be niceeee.
