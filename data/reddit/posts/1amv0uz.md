So here im dropper(took for nda interview and then jee/bits), now im done with interview so started preparing for bits specifically(jee k lie bhi kr rha hu but main target bitsat h)
So the thing is that im decently prepared for 12th topics(Phy,chem) and good at maths 12th all n even many 11th topics except 2-3 chapters.
Just need to revision.
So is it possible to start my preparation today to get CSE at bits or even any good branch.
I havent touched my books from last 4 months.
N if posssible then give me directions for best use of this time.
