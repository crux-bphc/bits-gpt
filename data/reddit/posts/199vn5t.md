# Is it dumb to repeat a 1st year 3 credit course in 2-1 as a phoenix student?
## u/Infinite_Issue2309 (Score: 10) (Flair: Academics)
I am a phoenix student who has to repeat a 1-1 3 credit CDC. This course is only offered in the 1st semester, and I am thinking that I will take it in 2-1 so that it doesn't hamper my PS1 or SI.

I'm a bit scared about this as a lot of seniors warn about 2-1 being very hard for phoenix students already. What would you recommend?

It's hard, but also depends on the course you will be repeating, although I would advise to clear your NC asap

if you're someone who studies well enough, won't be an issue at all imo

Entirely depends on your CGPA and grade in that course and how much do you think you can improve that grade by.
Don't keep high hopes from PS1, grade in 1 course won't change it much.
For SI, it's a lot of time and skills matter more once you have cleared the cgpa qualification barrier.

A friend of mine repeated M1 in 2-1 with M3, sharing the meme that we made 5 years back
