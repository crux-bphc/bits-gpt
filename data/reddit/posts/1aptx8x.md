# Bits goa turning into tier 3 college

Bits goa is unfortunately turning into a tier 3 college. Recently in the first year thermo course, the IC of the course prof. E. S. Kanan gave 0 to half of my batch because, 'students were talking while leaving the exam centre' which was just a shitty excuse to justify his childish tantrum coz his day was going bad. If this goes on , it wouldn't be long before bits goa known for its campus cultures turns into some tier 3 military school , where walking in a line is considered more important than academics. That professor has also personally threatened to make students life a hell because he holds a personal grudge against them. Such shitty professors, who threaten and manuplate grades are not required in this college at all.

Edited: talked with csa regarding this , prez to told the procedure is to joint file a petition and share it across to HoD and Director Sir with Dean Admin and Associate Dean AUGSD in cc. Write all the unprofessional abuses he hurled in cc lab in that mail.

2022 first sem we had him as MOW IC. In quiz 1 and 2, there were 2 sessions in the CC. And the paper was the same for both sessions. I was session 2 in both quizzes. Guess who got 8/8 in quiz component lmao

The session 1 ppl complained and the man sent this huge ass email. I remembered I laughed way too much after seeing it

Like bro just make different papers

Kanan is the one of the best professor in the whole college, although he is always sulking and brooding but he's a really good lecturer.

ES Kanna was a good lecturer but an absolute trash human being. He seeks to get some validation by imposing random rules on students for superiority. One time he threatened me that he'll mark me and my friend's papers that we were cheating when all we did was  to tell each other all the best before he even gave the papers. I reminded him that he hasn't even given the papers and we can discuss with the prof once he comes in for question clarifications. Shut him up real quick.

I do not think the management will ever allow that to happen ( allowing BITS to turn into a tier 3 Kaalaejj ).
