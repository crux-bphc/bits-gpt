# Road leading to Guest House

Why is the road leading to guest house mostly devoid of students? It doesn't seem to have anything special. 

However, got curious and tried that route once. 
It just ends at the guest house. It had a viewing deck.

On a new moon night, be there during devil's hour and you can find a mid-aged man (someone resembling my professor) sacrificing 15 millipedes and 2 rats to owl gods as a favor so that he can hire more ~~PhD candidates and post-doc scholars~~ slaves in his ~~research lab~~ academic sweatshop to further his seniority in the department. /s
