Really depends on the examiner, I've seen both kinds of extremes: literally giving free marks and the other one where model solution was followed right down to the last word

Around school level (more lenient actually). Of course, depends on subject and TA. Trw has shit checking, but every other subject only seeks to test ur understanding of a topic rather than rote answers. So in some ways it is more lenient than a school which cuts marks for just not including certain keywords.

It mainly depends on the IC and evaluator(usually done by PhD scholars). Being a PhD scholar, I often evaluate papers for first-degree students. We are given an answer key with a score breakdown. Some scholars grade leniently, while others grade harshly.

Often, different scholars will evaluate the same paper. So, unfortunately, luck also plays a role in who is grading your paper.
