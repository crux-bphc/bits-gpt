Hey so I am an US citizens doing my ug in india from top 3 nit (t/w/s) cse and have lived my whole life here. My end goal is to work in usa So I have 3 options

1. Directly go for MS but then this is a costly decision and mostly I have heard that MS is just a glorified migration ticket for foreigners to enter and work in usa, ms universities are more or less cashcows and dont give aid as it gives to us citizens for ug and phd.
2. Join a company in india which has usa offices and then ask for internal transfer and hope that it will happen fast as you are an usa citizen
3. Apply for usa jobs offcampus directly , but this is the most difficult thing and recruiter would have doubts on a non usa degree and any university in india is a no name university for a recruiter ,

What would you suggest and advice me

Hey Iâ€™m a first year in Maths department. I wanted to know how to get about writing and starting research. How do I approach a professor and when would be the right time to do so? Right now should I just focus on acads to guarantee CS as my dual degree? (I ended first semester with a cg of 9) Would highly appreciate your guidance!
