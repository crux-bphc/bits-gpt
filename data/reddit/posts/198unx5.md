After seeing the fact that this sem(4-2) there have been more companies for AI/ML/Full stack roles, compared to SDE, and a lot of product/analyst roles, is this the future of job market and will sde roles hold much importance in the coming years on campus placements/internships?

Is there any difference between SDE roll and the specific roles you mentioned? I thought most IT companies hire people with title SDE only, but assign the aforementioned after you join (while you're still considered an SDE, just that your work is specialised)

are the AI ML/other roles open only for CS? or CS+phoenix? or open for all?
