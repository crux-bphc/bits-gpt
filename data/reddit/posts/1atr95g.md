I am a EEE student in my 2-2. I require help with Microelectronic circuits. I tried attending lectures(anu gupta) but it was too high paced. The textbook(sedra) is too much. 

Ppl are saying to watch Razavi lectures but idts they align very much with our course plus they are of 91hrs. Please tell any resource to study this subject.

Start with lecture 29 and go till 41 of Razavi, this is a must.

Once you do these religiously you'll be set in the course. Then watch the BJT ones if you want.

Then watch the electronics 2 videos for post midsem syllabus

Watch the lectures of razavi, use his way of analyzing circuits. Do tut questions, repeatedly asked in mid sems. Old memories I remembered a tut test in which whole eee/eni students got 0.

Razavi aligns with the course. I personally stopped going to classes and did from that. It's a bit extensive but you can understand the concepts from that and solve PYQs which will help you out a lot.

Go slow and start clearing all fundamental concepts first. Attend class and ask all doubts to the prof after class or later, that's how I got through it.

Honestly, take lite BUT
focus on courses that are actually doable, and need way less effort like PoE/PoM, your HuEls, Control Systems and MuP even
Unless you wanna go for core
