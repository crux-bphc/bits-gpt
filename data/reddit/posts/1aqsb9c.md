Anyone knows about how good actually msc maths at bits is placement and caricullam wise and what career options would I have after opting it 

(Btw just wanted to confirm that it's a dual degree right?)

Math is preferred for a lot of roles in quant, data science, and applied math, especially if you can supplement it with a CS/Electronics BE. 

But you need to keep in mind that it is rigorous and you'll have a lot of pure math courses which can be hell if you don't put in the effort. The grading is on the harsher side and most of the teachers are pretty meh. If you dislike math then you'll hate your degree. (And since the type of math is completely different, it is difficult to judge beforehand whether you'll like it or not)

placements k liye your BE degree matters tbh, economics chorr k most dual degrees are fairly useless.
