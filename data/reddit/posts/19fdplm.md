# Personal freedom in BITS and other Indian universities

After experiencing college life for half a year, I have a few thoughts about freedom in BITS

Most of us can agree that BITS is a leader in India in terms of academic freedom. We get to make our own time tables and we have no centralized attendance policy. But on the other hand, I found BITS to be quite lacking in personal freedom. Here are some points:

**-Compulsory residence:** BITS requires its students to reside on its campus. I am sure that most students would stay even if this policy is removed but I don't think there should be compulsion. Same with mess food. You can say there is lack of healthy options on campus which is why mess registration is compulsory but clearly this isn't an issue in foreign universities where students are allowed to plan their own meals. Good options are lacking *because* of compulsory mess which drastically reduces demand.

**-Internet:** They say their network is for academic purposes only but hostels are for residence. They should allow us to access all websites or allow external broadbands.

&amp;#x200B;

**-Movement:** This is a gate-pass system and outstation system (gate pass is only for hyderabad, I think). These shouldn't be there imo. Except for first year students, everyone else is an adult and should be able to move freely in and out of the campus whenever they please. I have heard that these are demanded by parents which imo is a problem of its own. I the west, many people move out at 18 and live fully independently. They even pay their own fees. I feel that India would greatly benefit if college taught us to be independent rather than just being a continuation of school where parents get to decide where we go and what we do.

**-Hostels:** This is more of my personal desire but hostels should have more facilities. Many electrical appliances like heaters and coolers are not allowed (because the power supply can't handle them or something). I wish that hostel rooms could be well furnished with fridges ,etc. and be more like apartments but I get why this is not plausible (It would be extremely expensive to provide)

&amp;#x200B;

What is your opinion about these points? Many Indian universities have similar policies and imo it would take a change in Indian culture for these policies to change.

- Mess food in US universities do provide a ton of options, but are really expensive. BITS' mess is still better than most in India, and if they do improve it to match the US' level, prices will have to increase. It will be upto the SU and SSMS student bodies to check if majority will be okay with paying more than â‚¹400 per meal for a buffet. Food wastage would be another issue. Plus, students don't really plan their own meals here unless they live off campus. It's the same weekly menu system.

- Mobility in US universities is open because there's no campus system as such for most unis. Even those that do have a campus of their own don't have boundaries, and that increases crime rates so much. You'd be surprised at how many thefts, robberies, and other crimes happen around academic and residential buildings in the US. The system in India is meant for our own safety and protection.

Rest of your points are valid.

Fuck the hostels. These people are raking in hundreds of crores from fees, yet the facilities are non-existent.

Also the time to say goodbye to zero attendance policy is nearing. I'll refrain from sharing the exact details for anonymity but its from an administrative source.

These points seems valid but please remember that lot of freedom enjoyed by today's batch has been due to efforts by your alumni.

If we in 2009 didn't protested the draconian rules in Goa campus, 11:30 pm curb at Hostel Gate will still be there and no ANC would have been possible. So, students need to put strong effort to make any changes.

Regarding, outstation access/ hostel stay, I disagree a bit. Even if you are legally adult, I hardly think most of the 3/4 yearites are capable enough to take care of themselves in the outside. In Pilani, you can't do much and only in Goa or Hyderabad, outside stay may seem good. But at what cost? Will it help you focus more on acads/extra curricular activities? 

The 0 attendance rule is a boon for all but will feel like a curse to some who are used to disciplinary methods in their school/coaching. Most of us had flunked so many classes just for sake of it and had paid the price with our CGPA. Plus staying at campus helps you build bonding with your batchmates which will help you in adult life. I don't think a day scholar system can hold a candle to that aspect.

I agree with everything bruh, they wonâ€™t let us stay off campus so we can make our own food while at the same time they wonâ€™t let us cook our own food in the hostel

I agree with most of your points, especially the shower part.

I couldn't have a hot shower for 6 months ever since I came to the campus on day 1.

We're not allowed to use hair dryers, hair straighteners, and electric cokerss??
