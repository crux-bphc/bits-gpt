I should have stopped thinking of the "What ifs". "What if I had picked MSc Eco in Pilani instead of a circuit branch in Goa?" "What if I took a drop and tried to get into an IIT?"  


If I could tell my 17 yo self something, it would be to stop thinking about alternate reality.

1. Knowing that these next 4 years are going to be the best 4 years of your life. Hustle as much as you can and have fun in the process.

2. Acads WILL f*ck you bad if you don't take it seriously and being in a non circuit branch means you need to work twice as hard.

3. Brand name of bits is complementary and not a substitute for your skills and knowledge.
