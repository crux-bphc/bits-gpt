# What's so wrong about hyd. Bpharm?

Basically, the title. Even in iits people choose branches like metallurgy and textiles because of the iit tag. I don't understand what's so degradory if a person chooses bpharm.

It is not an engineering branch. Thus most companies won't allow you to sit for placements. And ofc fees are very high here.

Prolly because that is engg and this is not engg

It shouldn't be derogatory at all. It's likely that people's aspirations are more towards engineering.

Only immature people can slam other people's choices.

Nothing is wrong with it, I remember mentioning it in another comment a while back that if you go on LinkedIn you’ll find Bpharma alumni working at top private equity firms, mangament consulting firms, etc 

Stop listening to uncle, aunties and freshers who don’t have a single clue about career prospects

Elite mindset. Everyone likes to say all men are equal for brownie points but no one actually believes that.

Everyone else grinded to get here and got through cut throat competition, where once you're in an upper score/percentile it's a match of intellect alone. Meanwhile b.pharma gets served at a first come first serve basis.

Meritorious  students will always know they're superior to others. That's how they operate, regardless of what is true. Think I'm an asshole for saying this? Then you consider yourself superior than me because in your mind you have higher moral merit and I'm being blunt.

Is BITS tag anywhere near the IIT tag social wise ?

In terms of public opinion, not being an engineering degree and the absurdly low cutoffs.
