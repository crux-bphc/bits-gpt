# Regarding influx of aspirants’ posts and a reminder of rules

Future BITSians should be reminded of one of the main rules of the sub - all entrance exams or admissions related queries should go to the weekly thread. Feel free to report such posts. Queries regarding x college branch y vs a college branch b will also be removed. The mods try their best to remove them, but they may not catch our eyes immediately. I will advise to use Facebook’s BlTSAT Queries for such Qns. Or r/EngineeringAdmissions, r/JEE. 

Queries regarding review of courses or campuses are fine. Basically, any doubt that even a first year student might ask would be allowed. 

As a reminder to fellow BITSians who comment on aspirants’ posts, please be respectful. Even you were in that stage once upon a time. 

For seniors or alumni who wish to do AMAs, please drop a message or modmail. Those posts do help a ton of people.

Let me know if you all have any other comments or concerns. Thanks!
