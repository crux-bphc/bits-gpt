Is it possible to convert an informal project into a formal one? and also can we attend a course informally and then get it converted into a formal course?

You can add it. I don't know of any other possibilities

Apart from addition/substitution/audit(only for selected courses), there is no way to get a course that you haven't registered for. You can go talk or beg to the augsd dean or registration incharge if you have like a special case.
