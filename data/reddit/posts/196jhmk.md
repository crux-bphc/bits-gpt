# Navigating real friendships at BITS Pilani, need advice...

Struggling a bit to make deeper connections here; most friend circles seem established. I've got many acquaintances, but I'm eager for more genuine friendships. Tried making new friends,  but it seems conversations are intentionally limited to their own personal benefit,  It's becoming more of a 'hi-bye' scenario just exchanging pleasantries .

PS :   I feel like the social scene took a back seat amidst the cgpa hustle ...

Any tips or personal experiences you'd be willing to share?

Life is going to be like this from now on . Things are  mostly very transactional . 

Try playing a sport , get into the team or clubs/departments . Without a strong common reason there won't be depth in friendships.  Having said that I believe one shouldn't try to seek " friendship" , if it happens then good , otherwise life goes on . 

Good luck .

Deeper connections are not ‘made’, they are formed. Idea is to not put effort. Be genuine. Don’t be a faker or a social climber. Give it time. If nothing works out, enjoy the solitude. 
Move the centre of your happiness inside and not outside yourself. CGPA hustle is futile. 100s of low CGPA success stories available. Be logical, do what you enjoy. Add value to yourself. You are an adult now. Think and act like one.

In my first year, I missed my school friends dearly so I invested a lot of time to connect and make meaningful friendship with folks who I can vibe with. It has been almost a decade after college. All of us scattered across different countries and I am glad that most of us are still in touch. College and friends give you core memories.

I faced the same issue in my first year. In the second year, I won't say that the scene changed completely but it improved a little. But I realized a few things along the way- one of them is to stop looking for deep connections. People who seem to have many friends don't necessarily have genuine friendships and vice versa. The thing is I learned to very much like this feeling of loneliness, and now that has become a great perk to have. I don't avoid social connections altogether but even if I am feeling lonely, I can live with it happily. I was able to find satisfaction in pursuing skills that I love. I would suggest the same to you. When destiny wants, some genuine friendship will emerge on its own (and believe me it will come when you are not looking for it). You don't need to push for it. Till then, try to learn to live with this feeling (like embrace it). Because in future, that will give you way more security, than you can imagine now. Also don't ignore cgpa hustle. (It's important). Good luck!

Why u expecting a very good relationship immediately. It takes time, it might take more effort from ur side initially and then u can see if they opened up to you and they also started ma5ching the effort you put, and who take u for granted.
