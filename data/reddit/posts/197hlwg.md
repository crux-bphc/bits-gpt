since I'm in first year, I can't comment on the startup things. As far as HOT WATER in bathroom and water availability is concerned, Hyd campus has no such issues.  
You can get hot water 24 x 7 and water is available all the time. I think goa campus too would be the same as hyd. Pilani being in a desert might face some issues in this regard.  
You can't make your future decisions depending solely on these things.  
Currently you should be focusing on your JEE and BITSAT preparation instead of these useless stuff.

If temperature goes to 6-7, how is it BITS's fault??

Despite of all these things BITS will still be peoples choice after IITs, as they clearly outshine NITs and are the one of the best in market.

so this arguement holds no value

Over exaggerated, none of these are actual problems. You get hot water in the morning. Nahi mil rha toh take a bath in the afternoon lol. Startup culture is not overhyped, speaking from experience. Facilities and startup support may not be world class, but compared to other indian colleges this place is utopia lol. People will always find a way to complain

Hot water can be a issue in Pilani. But hey the solar heater takes time to heat up and everyone using a electrical geyser is the reason no one gets hot water. But 99% of Bits doesn't take a bath everyday, everyone sits for 3-4 days.Â 


For summers, these same fuckers leave the flush running and taps running because they can't be bothered and then complain about no water, try to save water yourself you fuckers and then complain.Â 


Startup culture is bullshit everywhere in India with delusional kids thinking they're going to be big with a copied product. Ain't something new.

I think placements are good in general for all, better for phoenix and best for CSE. Otherwise, I think other points are true.

Goa campus mein there are around 3-4 startups active rn

But yeah the "culture" is sort of dying

I've been running around for the past 2 weeks to help conduct the business plan competition, and its quite tough when not a lot of people are interested

Pilani kah toh pata nahi bat thoda thoda goa campus peh toh true hai. If you get Msc its culture is getting CS here nothing else, even in eco department. Profs also could do better to change the curriculum to be more in line with reality instead of giving 11th and 12th classes over 3 years along with some other new stuff like drm and such. Start up culture... Mat puch bhai there are good seniors who have done start upy stuff but most of it is let's say burning cash forever start ups. Imo if you can make s start up in campus you are very very good at convincing people to throw money at you. Or you are ridiculously wealthy.
