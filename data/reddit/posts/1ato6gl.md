## u/Perfect_Drink_6387 (Score: 16) (Flair: Career)
Hey all, i'm a 2nd year undergrad at Hyd campus(CS) and i cannot decide as to what path to work on for the future. Currently my aim is to get a SI in a good company, for which i am doing CC and DSA, but i also want to go for masters(preferably in ML/AI), for which i haven't done anything significant(like SOPs, personal projects etc.), so can anyone tell me what should i do next so that i have a good profile at the time for applying for masters and also when should i apply for masters.

You'll find students applying for masters anywhere from right after graduation to 3 years after graduation. After that there is not much to gain from a master's degree unless you plan on switching fields.

LoRs are going to be significant for a good application. So do some SOPs, and try for a TA. Your PS2 should get you a professional LoR. That should be enough for a decent masters application right out of college. Active involvement in technical clubs also helps out. 

Other than that, your CGPA is going to matter a lot for some colleges. There are specific things that help with some colleges, for that you need to figure out what programs and what universities you're interested in. That is probably too premature right now though.

One thing I will say is, carefully evaluate the RoI of a foreign masters for yourself. If you get a decent job in India right out of college, and you want masters degree purely for a salary hike, chances are it's not going to be worth it.

In addition to what u/nokeldin42 said, you could also do a thesis in your last year. That could give you some exposure to research and also a good LOR, which will help you with applications.   
In my opinion, it would be better to go for MS after a few years of work experience. It helps immensely in internship and job search during your MS, particularly in the current market, although you are in the 2nd year now and I do not know how things will change in the near future.

CG? Target schools? Research interests?  


In any case, more than 75% of folks are much better off just working for 2-3 years before going for a Masters.
