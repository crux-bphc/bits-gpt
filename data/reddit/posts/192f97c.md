Hi Iâ€™m a prospective student at BITS looking to study CS. Is it possible to pursue 2 majors? For example doing CS with electrical engineering?

It is allowed but hardly ever granted. One guy did it in 2016 iirc. You need Uber high cg to get it and convince the admin.

Theoretically possible, practically most probably impossible. 

And the course duration will also become 5-5.5 years.

Info as of 2014 Goa. You need to be in the top 10 after the first year, if you have EEE you could add CSE and vice versa. But if you are admitted on another BE or MSc, I'm not sure if it works.
