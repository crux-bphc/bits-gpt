# Is BITS Pilani better tha NITs?
## u/False_Error9116 (Score: 0) (Flair: Future BITSian)
I am not sure but my relatives and friends say that nit's are a better college as compared to bits. BUT I personally feel that bits has so much to offer. Is there any significant difference considering the fees?

Unless you are in the top 5 IITs with the same branch, there is no reason for this comparison. Give the exam, get the rank, evaluate your choices based on the branch you might get and your interests. I know people who have been absolutely delighted when I got into BITS. There have been people who have suggested me to take admission in the top 5 with lower branches for the tag, and in NITs because it is government. I personally had no interest in NITs. Yes the top 3 are good but I would still give branch preference if it's between top 3 NITs and BITS.

I am not demeaning any campuses or anything. I had a personal preference regarding BITS campus as well and hence I took which suited my plans and goals the most. I believe you should also first carry out your duties and then see what rewards you are getting and then make an informed choice. I strongly believe that once one hears that something is worse than the other, the motivation for the latter reduces. Hence do not fall into this trap.

Well, imo, kinda yes. Bits pilani is also probably better than nitt. That being said, nitt gives probably just about similar placements(well, maybe just a bit lower) than bits, despite having hell lot of reservations, and 1/3rd of the fees. But the peer group in bits is of course better. And jee competition is higher of course. I got bits pilani civil in my 1st attempt, but didn't get nothing in nitt, so had to take a drop. Anyway, both r gr8.

NITs gayi chaa mudane.. BITS is better than many IITs and equivalent to top IITs. And talking about Jadavpur.. saale Bengali quota leke baithe h and calling themselves as a top tier college's student. BITS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Any college of India (except top 6-7 IITs and IIIT HYDERABAD these are of the same league.)

BITS only problem is their fees now which is increasing exponentially,  now ik people will bark and say we have scholarships and need based scholarships based on cg each semester but that thing is unpredictable and enough to turn off many people. BITS must find ways to reduce it's fees or else the ROI isn't worth it. Those who say bits placement are more I can definitely agree but then the loan you have taken will equalise it.

Bhai campus matters, please mention what campus of bits and what NIT. There is nothing that can be said as a general statement about all BITS campuses and all NITs. Too much variance in placements and value

NIT Trichy &gt;= BITS P &gt; BITS G &gt; NIT Surathkal &gt;= BITS H

Though BITS H is improving at an nice rate so I would take that over Surathkal still.
