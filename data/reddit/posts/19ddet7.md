Can a dualite do a summer term after 4-2 when they have done a summer term after 3rd year as well ? Would i still be able to do double ps after doing a summer term after 4,2?

You can do a summer term after 4-2 but you’ll have to do thesis in 5-1 and ps2 in 5-2. I’m a 2022 batch dulla and all the seniors I asked said the same. But I’d still recommend you to ask some seniors coz again I don’t know if I’m 100% correct
