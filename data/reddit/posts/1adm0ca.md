# Sem1 vs Sem2 placements.
## u/royalclasher07 (Score: 21) (Flair: Academics)
I have asked many seniors and all seem to have contradictory opionions

My cg : 8.5

domain:IT

branch: pheonix

SI: no si offer

campus: Pilani

\*Some are saying that ur cg is good, so going for sem2 placement would be a mistake since sem2 companies pay low

\*Others are saying u might get good ps2 in sem1 at same cg, and also many were unplaced in sem1 placements, so thereby go for sem2 placements and also since u don't have an SI offer so you don't even have a backup of SI ppo

&amp;#x200B;

Plzz help!
