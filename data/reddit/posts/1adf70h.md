Hey, I am a Btech graduate considering an Mtech degree from Bits Hyderabad or Dubai, I would highly appreciate if I could know how much money would be needed for the same including all the concerned expenses, an approximate would greatly help. Also I made up my mind to go for Mtech from a reputed college as I graduated from a tier 3 college with 1 placement offer of 4lpa, I personally believe such a package is not practical to rely on, and considered Mtech option in hopes of more promising opportunities, kindly advice

Did Mtech from Pilani campus in CSE. Fees were around 13 lakh for me for 2 years. So for the Hyderabad campus it will be almost the same.

Avoid Dubai if you are serious. Placements here are worse than tier 3 colleges. Only 5-10 people from a batch get good companies, the rest are generally unplaced.
