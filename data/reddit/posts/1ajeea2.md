I am having a really hard time understanding EEE in my first year. Being an ECE student I don't wanna ignore this problem. Can someone suggest me some YouTube channels that I can follow to study on my own?

Navneet sir's book is pretty good. Try solving the solved examples by yourself, and read the theory if you aren't able to solve.
Before midsems and compres, solve the pyqs, 2 papers would be enough ig.
Worked fine for me, Got an A- with this much
