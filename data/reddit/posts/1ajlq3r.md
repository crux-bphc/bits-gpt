# Opinions on *Bits Law Mumbai*

I recently got into Bits Law and was considering it as a serious choice for law. There are many opinion on the college such as the price and the fact that this batch would be the second one.

Could someone please give a comprehensive opinion on this?

I doubt there are many bits law students here. This is primarily an engineering (BITS Pilani, X campus) sub.

Consider going to law school focused subs instead.
