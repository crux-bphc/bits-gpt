Should I rely on Mcn scholarships or any other kinds of scholarships as I belong to middle class family and can't afford bits fees.

Over 250 people **from each batch** got some sort of scholarship in Pilani campus.

If your family income is below 15 LPA, then you're eligible for some % of scholarship under MCN, provided you score a CGPA over a certain number, which is probably 7.5-8+ (not sure, but whatever it is, it's doable and requires basic and consistent effort from your side, difficulty may vary according to branch cause grading is very subjective).

You'll also get loans easily at 6% from SBI iirc which'll take care of your dual fee, PS fee as well. 

If you need a 80-90% scholarship, then you'll have to get a 9-9.5+ CG, which is difficult honestly, but not impossible.
