# Macbook Air M1 Vs Samsung Book 2 pro in 2024
## u/AKC_007 (Score: 1) (Flair: Misc)
My usecase is around day to day work with good number of meetings, very intermediate softwares like Figma and some video editing. 

One concern I have is around software updates, How long does Air M1 might get updates as it's the model from 2020.

Looking for something productive and lag free experience with good battery life. As a windows user, Battery life is been terrible experience.

I'm getting MacBook Air M1 for Rs 67,000 and Samsung Book 2 pro for 58,000.

My eyes are also on M2 Pro base version, which is quoted around Rs 1.09 Lakhs (Out of my budget but still can go)


Which one should I prefer?  Please suggest

Don't even look at m2 for such huge price difference... If m2 is available at 8-10k more than m1 only then it is better.
Go for m1 if you are ok with troubles of macos. Else windows, and there are many options in that area.

My say would be, take the m1 deal.

Edit: ok wait you said MacBook pro m2. Well then you can see that deal too, all depends on your use case. Since it's light for now, I'll again say take it liye and buy m1. Maybe when you start using the laptop heavily then go for MacBook pro
