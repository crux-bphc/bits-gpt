# How to make more friends/connect with seniors?

I feel like my social circle is very limited. I know very few people from my batch, and even if I talk to new ones, it's just hi/bye. I am not in any club/dept right now, and that makes it tougher. How can I talk to more people on campus?

Find something common, maybe you just want to ask some doubts related to career etc, anything. Ping them and go to their bhawan and talk.
