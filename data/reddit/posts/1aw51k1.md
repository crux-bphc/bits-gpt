# How to get a reverse dual in Goa Campus?

I am in B.E. ECE first year and have been considering trying to get a reverse dual to M.Sc. Physics + B.E. ECE. Always been quite interested in physics and I feel the physics knowledge will help me since I eventually wanna end up in some research work (industrial or academic, either is fine) even if I do only B.E. ECE. Can anyone tell me the procedure for it and CG cutoff? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Ask augsd

But considering horizontal transfer criteria, you need a pretty high cg

I'd say 9 minimum
