Yeah unfortunately :( . During Inauguration we round up all the droppers and pelt them with jagged stones while chanting "Shame! Shame!"

They are not allowed to shit in the same washroom as freshers

No. I was a dropper myself and there's no difference. You'll find many other droppers too

No discrimination just a small tradition. They make sure we use our potential to the maximumâ€¦ from the clock tower

No, I have quite a few dropper friends and nobody judges them. Some people might make a joke about it occasionally but that's all it is, a joke

Don't think about BITS right now bro , you still have time , prepare properly for jee main 2nd attempt and advance you will get a good branch and college . Even I am a dropper and I used to overthink about which college should I join instead of studying and I ended up in BITS . And to answer your question , there is no discrimination towards droppers in BITS .
