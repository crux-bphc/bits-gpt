# BITS HD(Masters) preparation advice - leave job or not
## u/Efficient_Sandwich95 (Score: 1) (Flair: Future BITSian)
Hello all, I wanted to get into BITS for my master's, I belong to the electrical branch. I know my gate score will come very less hence i was targetting BITS HD test, I haven't started with my core subject preparation hence I was planning to leave my current JOB and start preparing for it from march till april.    


Can any masters students advise me on how to go about this? should i leave my job or continue with it. My current job is not permanent as well, i may be on contract for like more 2 years or so.

Do not leave your job, Keep your focus on BITS HD. Try solving GATE 1 mark PYQs and donâ€™t get demotivated if you are not able to solve 2 mark questions. You can easily crack BITS HD, just start preparing, you have like 3 months left in the exam. Masters from BITS can actually form a great future ahead.
