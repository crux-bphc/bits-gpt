 Joined Vivek's session today (From F111 to grabbing great internships) and found some good points. Anyone else considering putting together an ICPC team?

After attending Vivek's session i was randomly going through his content and surprisingly found this underrated video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV8iWNC67QM&amp;t=4483s) having details related to very hidden helpful resources for competitive programming . You should visit atleast once.

Not looking for the team but I too attended the session, the guy's literal god in CP. Just found out he's an international master on CF: https://codeforces.com/profile/GodSpeed98

New random accounts posting only for Vivek. Something fishy? Vivek PR team?
