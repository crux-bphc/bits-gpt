Bits offers msc maths which is integrated into a dual. No BSc degree is offered

No. Only MSc Maths Or MSc maths with B. E.

It is called Msc math but the course structure is similar to a bachelors in mathematics so if you want to study math after 12th, msc math is a good option

Keep in mind you are allotted an engineering degree as well (though you can choose to not pursue it if you want)
