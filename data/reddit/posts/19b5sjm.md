# Goa is the worst for finance

Less than 100-120 seats for Fufa, Drm.

Fin minor cutoff unlike other campuses.
Getting fin courses at the mercy of PR number that too not all are offered every sem. ERP crashes every fucking time and their response is “sorry too much traffic sarr”.

Shitty grading.

Arrogant and useless augsd.

Sadist profs.

Coming to goa for finance was the worst fucking decision of my life. 
Hyd folks have it way better.

CG cutoffs have been low since DS minor was introduced. I am sure same trend would have followed till now.

might agree a little on the other points but cutoff for fin minor is miserably low, shouldn't even complain about that. if you can't even get like 5.7+ then you should prolly aim for something else cuz minor leke bhi off shoot to lana padta hai
