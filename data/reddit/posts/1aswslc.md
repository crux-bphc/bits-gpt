 My brother is planning to pursue an MBA from BITS Pilani. He has a BBA degree and a CAT score of 87 percentile. 

Is this the right choice to make? Is it worth doing an MBA from BITS Pilani?

his qualifications - BBA - 74%, CAT - 87 percentile

Bitsom is worth it

I have a simple logic, if I’m going to spend 1/2 years full time and X amount of money on masters. It needs to be a top 5 QS world ranked university. Otherwise I simply don’t see the ROI. 

Every uncle and brother has a MBA now, it’s not worth the ROI unless it’s coming for a really good uni. Explore alternate opportunities. I’m not sure where your brother is in life rn but I’d definitely explore giving GMAT and applying to HEC, ESSADE, INSEAD and the rest.
