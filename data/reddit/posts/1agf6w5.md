Hello, Dualite in CS and currently in 4-2.  I am still not successful in getting an internship.  Is my low CGPA to be blamed?  What should be my options, please?

Your cgpa isn't that low.
Also you are a dualite, so please don't try for SI unit it's really a good company. Because you can do Dual PS, which indeed is a better option.
