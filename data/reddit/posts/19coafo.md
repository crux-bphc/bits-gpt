using a throaway cus idw be doxxed but i didnt know previously that gundas werent just in poor places. for context, we had people in our hostel throw big bombs right outside my room(very very very loud) and chant jai sri ram(im even hindu born) like it is some kind of chest thumping. i get that youd wanna celebrate but at the cost of others peace?? also why the banging of doors and shouting at every room to wear bhagwa??even tho i dont really practice, i still think im closer to god than these goons cus i have a personal rltsp with him and not in it cus of a trend or to look superior. if anyone who did this is reading, stop doing it, ram wont bless u cus u shouted his name to annoy people a few times.

actual mob behaviour, but then I'm an anti-national terrorist if I call them out. And no, I'm not excusing any other religion which does the same shit if you're frothing to call me a "hypocrite"

I'm a Non religious/Atheist person from Muslim Background and I got "Jai shri Ram" moj on the 22nd. I have no problem with JSR or with Jesus or with any other slogans but for that person to find my Room Number and Hostel from SWD and Send me this specially on the 22nd even though MOJ has been going in Goa for like the past 2-3 days felt really bad. I never think about these things but such things also come as a slap on face

bro i see what you are talking about but you are no 50 yrs old sick guy you are in college and these are the ways college students behave they. Have fun with them enjoy the chaos make friends whats this karren mentality. And if you are that busy just go to library hostels are not meant to be a peaceful place. We had a birthday in our hostel the other day and the whole hostel floor was forcefully dragged out to have fun and at the end of the day we enjoyed alot those who wanted to study just went To workplaces or Library.Our collage even states that hostels are not the place for work thats what libraries are for.
