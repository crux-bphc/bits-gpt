Hello guys, I'm a BITS WILP student. Pursuing my Bsc in Computing and Design. I choose WILP because I work in HCLTech. 

What are your views on this degree? (As you are a regular college going student)

i recently made post on the experience. Not sure about BSC. But for Mtech, donâ€™t do it. worthless (learning and value) prospective. You could do some course online from Youtube or Coursera, do couple projects and pursue a job instead

Not very much worth it. Depends on the individual on how they make out of it, but mostly not so helpful career wise. If you want to boost your career it would always be better to go for a proper bsc/ms/mtech
