This is especially for the people in Humanities and Social Science Department, but anyone can answer it if you know about it. 
What is the culture there? Is attendance mandatory to avail institute fellowship? Should one live in the hostel or outside, considering phd scholars need their freedom? How often can one go home/out of town? 
Looking for genuine answers please.

The only aspect I can speak about is, you will have to live inside the campus in a hostel, but you will be given much more freedom than us undergrad students. No in-time, no checking at the gate etc
