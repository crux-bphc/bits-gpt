## u/Randomsme (Score: 14) (Flair: Future BITSian)
I am wondering if any of you have access to the syllabus of the new B.E. Mathematics and Computing course. It looks like an interesting alternative to C.S. for aspirants. Can any of you share insights about this course ?

Thanks!

Take only if you like hardcore math 
Else, you won't survive 

I know a lot delulu ppl who took this branch in other colleges or even here (Msc math)
Now they are struggling as college math isn't a piece of cake 

Most of those took that as they thought only about "good placements", jabki ab unki cg 6 ke niche hai, for them even registration for placement seems tough now 

Now they are crying over this ðŸ˜‚
