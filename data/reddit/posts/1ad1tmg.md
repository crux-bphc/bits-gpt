The only hindrance a low GPA has is in campus placements and masters applications.

Couple of years down the line - no one cares about your CG. You don’t get a good PS and placement in your final year. Work hard to crack that first job, and everything resets.

Feel free to DM for any help - former 5 point someone.

Honest feedback here. I had a cgpa of 5.08 during my placement sem and graduated with a cgpa of 5.51. You are set back by a few years, but only if you haven’t found your calling yet. I got placed in the zeroth/golden week in Futures First which was a decent opportunity and which I thought was my calling. But, turned out it wasn’t. So, I worked my ass off for the next 7-8 years and have done pretty good for myself. If you talk about the money, it took me longer than my high cgpa peers to reach where I am. But the journey has been remarkable. Never has my low cgpa ever been a talking point.

IIT hota toh jhaat barabar matter karti hai CG. But for BITS, VIT, Manipal, SRM, low cg means no placement according to seniors in Goa campus
