# Bits Pilani dubai. What do you think?
## u/lakshmidurgashri (Score: 22) (Flair: Future BITSian)
 I am a student in Bahrain applying to Bits Pilani dubai and UOWD for B.E in Mechanical engineering. I wanted to know whether the degree is recognized internationally by countries like Singapore and stuff, I am not planning to work in Dubai. My aim is to get a UG degree and do masters and settle in Singapore. What do you think?

I know ppl from BITS Dubai at Stanford and in the Bay Area, so I guess it is internationally recognised.

Fellow BPDC student here, it’s great for masters. Infact I’d say it’s very easy to stack extra circulars with acads considering that academics is pretty chill here (not too hard getting 9+). This combined with the degree would definitely prove useful.

I know a decent number of alumni in Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, London Business School and the rest. Good luck!

Man try to get in somewhere else. It’s really not worth it and you might have a better shot elsewhere. The quality of students studying there, opportunities for internships (placements are basically non-existent) and faculty is really not worth the money you’ll end up spending.
