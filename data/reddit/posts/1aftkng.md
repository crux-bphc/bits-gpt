# How to get a ML Research Internship
## u/Majestic_Onion_2214 (Score: 15) (Flair: Academics)
I am interested in a research internship in foreign universities . I have done some good projects in ML (Anomaly Detection) and some Kaggle Competitions as well. The problem is that my CG is too low ( around 7.5). I am in my 2 nd year of college. Can any seniors give some advice ?

no offence but is 7.5 cg low?

Don’t fixate on unis abroad if you don’t have projects with profs on campus first, there’s plenty of profs who research in the field so start on a project under them first. After you have a decent amount of exposure only then start cold mailing for online research internships to profs abroad, you need to sell yourself. Hopefully something productive comes out of these and you can use them to sell yourself for funded research internships offline for the summer of 3-2 or thesis. But even with all this, it’s really fucking hard to get a funded research opportunity. I have a similar cg and have been fortunate enough to secure a funded research opportunity at a university abroad and this was roughly the path I followed, feel free to pm if you need to. Also just a caveat, this is simply what I did, replicating the same might not yield the same results, at the end of the day the whole RI/thesis process is incredibly luck/connection based.

You could probably get an offline research stint at an IIT over the summer (almost guaranteed to be unpaid though). Also, anomaly detection and kaggle really aren't a lot for research positions, I'd recommend reading more papers and getting a better grasp of things.
Remote foreign research isn't a bad idea also, it depends on the prof you get and how much work you put in, a few folks get decent papers out of things like this

Getting funded research internships is pretty difficult, especially for your second year. This is where your high CG (which you are not even close to) would shine since that is the first thing most advisors would look at, and this would be good enough to reject you immediately. Also, you have to note that most universities are not dying to fund foreign second-year students. You would have better luck in your third year. You can of course do an unpaid remote research internship at XYZ place but it is only slightly less useless than doing nothing at all. It is not even an internship technically but hey you get LinkedIn flex points among those who don't know any better. I would suggest if you actually care about work and do not just want to have a tag of some random foreign university do an internship in India among the most research-oriented colleges such as iisc or iit b or iiit h. If you are good enough, a lot of these will be paid as well and you will get to work onsite.
