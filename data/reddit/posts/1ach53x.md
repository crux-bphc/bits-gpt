# Any 7-pointer alumni here? Just wanted to know where are you know and how you're doing

Hey, I'm from 2020 batch, recently placed and now contemplating the future. Probably due to the market situation, I didn't get an offer in the industry of my choice, and took the first non-tech offer I got. 


While I'm glad to get placed, I'm also a bit lost. I know little about how the career trajectory looks like for a non tech career, and additionally as the title probably implies, I have a 7.X CG (below 7.5, won't go above it after the sem ends). Additionally, I'm in a circuit (EEE dept) branch.


A science masters is also pretty much a no go for me, as I've gradually lost much of the interest I had in studying science subjects, even those from CnI minor (like OOP, OS, etc.) For each of these courses, I had some or the other major complaint which made me tell myself "never again." 


So I just wanted to learn experiences of other BITSians around the same CG as me. How is life looking for you know, and what are you working towards.

Hey, 2018 CSE alumni here. 
My CG was around 7.3 during placements.
I wasn't very well prepared with DSA for placements.

Ended up in an American old tech company offering only 12 LPA.

Got my PS2 in VMware. Couldn't get a PPO because my team was on a hiring freeze.

I was prepping for off- campus roles in parallel with PS2. 
Got interview calls from 10 companies over 4 months and got rejected by all before finally getting an offer from a super app in South East Asia for 25 LPA.

Worked there for one year before bring impacted in a layoff.

Currently on a break and looking to  get better at DSA and development. Not looking for a role immediately but have been contacted by Google, Amazon and Confluent for interviews. Will look to get back soon but only after I feel I have addressed the gaps in my fundamentals. Have enough savings to ride out at least 4 years.

In short, life sorts itself out, confusing as it may seem in college.

Hey, i am a EEE alum, with similar CG range. Its been almost around a decade for me since college. 
Id like to say i am doing pretty good. I work in non-core now but ive started with good core work ex. 7 cg wise is a good threshold number to get a foot in the door anywhere you aspire to be. Its not amazing that people presume you never did anything apart from acads, its not bad to believe you cannot pull through and learn stuff. It becomes more of an indicator that there is performance, just that its focus/effort based at times. 
Once you start having work experience, the importance of cgpa decreases drastically. Its the real world skills that you acquire that help move further. 

Hit me up with any specific questions you have, id be happy to answer / guide further. 

Remember, its a lifelong thing and this was just a part of it. You can (and will probably have to) always keep learning and growing!

This sounds too familiar to me. I'm a EEE grad as well, with cg near 7. I kind of liked some of the subjects, but the EEE curriculum was too hectic for me. I usually couldn't understand the stuff being taught, and spent the whole semester going off tangents trying to get hold of some concepts, or just killing time on fifa. Then took the first non tech offer in placements, market ke baare m sunke fatne lagi thi lol. It's a decent job and the growth will be good. There are some batchmates working with me, who are great people. They take genuine interest in work, unlike me, and so, are good at it. I can't imagine to keep on doing this, though. 
I'm studying some maths in spare time, leftovers from my final sem thesis (which I did not complete as well), and feel like I'm halfway decent at it. I'll take a shot at some masters program in Cryptology or CS this year. 
There's a lot of interesting research going on.. 

This is what's it like for me, career wise, more or less. Apart from that, life's vanilla.
