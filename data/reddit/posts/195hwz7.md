Sorry if this question has been posted before. But I'm a partial dropper currently studying for JEE and BITS. I want to pursue Mechanical Engineering out of Interest, but just for security, is ITTM's BS Data Science course worth it?

Mech engineering in BPPC is worth it, focus on Bitshit

Mech is a good branch in bits tbh
Go for the bs degree only if you wish to do a it job

as a mechie at BITS Goa, idk much about mech at BITS cause I'm just first year, but IITM DS is pure bullshit totally waste of money.

If you are in BITS then no. It is just a copium degree for Tier 3 crowd
