Does anyone uses a wifi repeater is thier hostel room (especially goa)?  If yes how do I configure it since the network needs user login?  Any help would be appreciated.

I would say don’t even use the wifi repeater because once u connect any such devices the it dept is gonna flag it and disable ur lan port so don’t do it and moreover u can’t by pass the user login of bits network it’s hardwired
