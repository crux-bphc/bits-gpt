I'm feeling really undeconfident in thermo. Could any senior or freshie who did well in the course give some guidelines. 

Campus is goa if that helps

Why not walk up to a senior in campus for help?

It's concerning that freshies are asking doubts on reddit rather than directly asking their mentors or other seniors. Aur abhi to kya hi late hua hai. Anyone will pick your calls before midnight. Try making more offline connections!

Try to understand the tut solutions, they cover all the concepts. Also before introducing entropy, it's pretty straightforward ngl

I recently completed thermo and upped my grade from C- to B, and there's only one advice I can give, keep practicing tut questions. That alone can guarantee you an A-, maybe even an A. If you get stuck, see the solutions but then don't forget that question for the rest of your sem. :)
