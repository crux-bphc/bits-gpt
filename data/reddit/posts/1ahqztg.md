Don't be scared bro you know what you have to do just do it and you'll be alright.

Just work hard bro.

Try pushing for 7.5 cg. This would require major slog from your end.

As long as your finance minor offshoot is good, you can get into those banks for PS2

You have ps1 cg boost and 3 sems before ps, so dw, work hard every sem, it’s doable

Keep in mind that for sem 1 PS, CG and offshoot till 3-1 will be considered, and usually sem 1 PS offers good PS stations at a relatively low CG than in sem 2 (Due to SI students and sem 1 placement students, that have higher CG comparatively), I have observed that the same stations have a difference of  0.8+ CG going from sem 1 to 2. So keep in mind that you need to push for maximising your CGPA in 2-2, preferably summer term, and 3-1. because your efforts to get a better CG in 3-2 will be more or less be offset by the increased CG criteria in sem 2 for the same station. 

My advice-

*  Try to maximize your CG until 3-1, don't rely till 3-2 for CG to increase. What I mean is don't target a steady 8.5(+-0.2) SG each sem till 3-2, rather brute force 9.2+ SG for 2-2 and 3-1
* Try to complete all courses till 3-1, including FRAM, even if it entails taking a summer term, because that's the best shot you got to complete courses without clashes.
* I know its a tough ask, but you have to do. CGPA is not everything, but is of much significance, just as it goes with money. Having a below 7 CG in placements will also hinder you to sit for some placement opportunities, no matter how much other people say that CGPA criteria is not there for many companies. These are the companies that are coming for 8LPA package in current sem placements, so choose what you want. There is also internal CGPA filtering before they send you test link for placements which is not transparent at all. So maximize CG to be in a chooser position rather than beggar one.
* I might be a bit biased opiniated considering a tough placement season, and have opinions relevant for current conditions, also in coming 2 years market conditions will definitely improve. But preparing for the worst will make you ready for anything and everything, and make relatively good market conditions a cakewalk for you.
