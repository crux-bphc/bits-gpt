        "title": "Personal freedom in BITS and other Indian universities",
        "text": "After experiencing college life for half a year, I have a few thoughts about freedom in BITS\n\nMost of us can agree that BITS is a leader in India in terms of academic freedom. We get to make our own time tables and we have no centralized attendance policy. But on the other hand, I found BITS to be quite lacking in personal freedom. Here are some points:\n\n**-Compulsory residence:** BITS requires its students to reside on its campus. I am sure that most students would stay even if this policy is removed but I don't think there should be compulsion. Same with mess food. You can say there is lack of healthy options on campus which is why mess registration is compulsory but clearly this isn't an issue in foreign universities where students are allowed to plan their own meals. Good options are lacking *because* of compulsory mess which drastically reduces demand.\n\n**-Internet:** They say their network is for academic purposes only but hostels are for residence. They should allow us to access all websites or allow external broadbands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**-Movement:** This is a gate-pass system and outstation system (gate pass is only for hyderabad, I think). These shouldn't be there imo. Except for first year students, everyone else is an adult and should be able to move freely in and out of the campus whenever they please. I have heard that these are demanded by parents which imo is a problem of its own. I the west, many people move out at 18 and live fully independently. They even pay their own fees. I feel that India would greatly benefit if college taught us to be independent rather than just being a continuation of school where parents get to decide where we go and what we do.\n\n**-Hostels:** This is more of my personal desire but hostels should have more facilities. Many electrical appliances like heaters and coolers are not allowed (because the power supply can't handle them or something). I wish that hostel rooms could be well furnished with fridges ,etc. and be more like apartments but I get why this is not plausible (It would be extremely expensive to provide)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is your opinion about these points? Many Indian universities have similar policies and imo it would take a change in Indian culture for these policies to change.",

                "text": "- Mess food in US universities do provide a ton of options, but are really expensive. BITS' mess is still better than most in India, and if they do improve it to match the US' level, prices will have to increase. It will be upto the SU and SSMS student bodies to check if majority will be okay with paying more than \u20b9400 per meal for a buffet. Food wastage would be another issue. Plus, students don't really plan their own meals here unless they live off campus. It's the same weekly menu system.\n\n- Mobility in US universities is open because there's no campus system as such for most unis. Even those that do have a campus of their own don't have boundaries, and that increases crime rates so much. You'd be surprised at how many thefts, robberies, and other crimes happen around academic and residential buildings in the US. The system in India is meant for our own safety and protection.\n\nRest of your points are valid.",

So, students need to put strong effort to make any changes.\n\nRegarding, outstation access/ hostel stay, I disagree a bit. Even if you are legally adult, I hardly think most of the 3/4 yearites are capable enough to take care of themselves in the outside. In Pilani, you can't do much and only in Goa or Hyderabad, outside stay may seem good. But at what cost? Will it help you focus more on acads/extra curricular activities? \n\nThe 0 attendance rule is a boon for all but will feel like a curse to some who are used to disciplinary methods in their school/coaching. Most of us had flunked so many classes just for sake of it and had paid the price with our CGPA. Plus staying at campus helps you build bonding with your batchmates which will help you in adult life. I don't think a day scholar system can hold a candle to that aspect.",

I don't know if I have any mental issue like ADHD (My parents wont let me test because being diagnosed with mental illness is a matter of shame in society) but I find any live lecture difficult to remember. Self study is the only way for me. From 11th class I have been attending offline coaching, learning absolutely nothing, and then relearning everything at home through youtube. I thought atleast after joining BITS I won't be forced to go to lectures. Unfortunately exit tests were introduced to the very campus I chose. In sem 1, I haven't spoken to any person other than my roommate, I made no friends, joined no clubs. I spent the mornings attending classes and evening studying from youtube/books.  \n\n\nLosing grades gives me severe anxiety. I wakeup many times in the middle of night thinking about losing marks. I have had panic attacks about marks many times. I went to classes even though I was very sick (because exit tests are surprise tests in some courses). My mental health has been completely destroyed. I sit in classes knowing my time is being wasted. I keep feeling that I am wasting my life away. Why am I listening to classes if I have to relearn everything anyway? If I don't get high CG I wont get placed. My life will get ruined. These are the thoughts in my head.  I still have to suffer for 3 years.  What do I do? My college life is getting wasted in front of my eyes and I am unable to do anything.",

I think that it usually requires a large amount of cold mailing.  \n\n\n2) Most people I know only had course projects/assignments on their resume (OOP/DBS/DSA, and a very small minority had done computer graphics). Academic projects are differentiated and better than course projects IMO. An internship, academic or not, has greater value than just projects though.  \n\n\n3) NUS is the most common institute for off campus thesis from what I have seen. If you do an SI, you would probably have to go for a 5-1 thesis without any choice, since SI clashes with 5-1 PS. Also, the situation might improve by your time, but currently, getting an approval for off campus thesis from the CSIS HoD is very difficult.",

                "text": "I think I'm qualified to answer this considering I was against BPDC for the longest time, I'm a 2nd Year CS student and a student council member. Not a simple answer. And as cliched as it sounds it's what you make of it. I don't know what your expectations are but I'll try to address as many points as I can.   \n\n\n1. Placements / PS Stations : Avg CS Placement at 5-6K AED per month, but the overall placement or PS Station is pretty mediocre unless you have a 9+ CGPA. Above 9 you have great companies like Emirates, Reckitt, MSD, Siemens, PWC etc. \n2. Fests and Campus Life : I'll be realistic here, campus is 14 acres. We are a small campus both in terms of size of campus and number of people. We have a total of 1.2K Students across 4 years. That's probably how much the Indian Campus intakes per year. So the number of fests and fests themselves are proportionally less \"cooler\". \n3. Hostel/Day Scholar : Hostel is single occupancy and that's probably the biggest perk. Mess food is mediocre at the moment. Day Scholar's have transport to and from uni. The life of a day scholar is more or less like school, you're on campus at 7:30AM and leave at 3:40PM. Campus is 25 mins away from the main city, via public transport 40mins-60mins - this is a con. I wouldn't really recommend BPDC if you're not already a resident in UAE. Please read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/13iy26f/comment/jralkab/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). \n4. Masters Options and Academics + Scholarships : It's fairly easy to get a good CG since it's a mostly mediocre batch when it comes to academics (mediocre academically because the barrier to entry is pretty non existent at BPDC). This will help for both your first job as well as masters application. A BITS Pilani Degree with 9+ CG is definitely a good look for masters. Scholarships are pretty rewarding here, 10% for 8+, 15% for 8.5+ and 25% for 9+ CGPA. \n5. International Exposure : It's not necessarily false advertisement by BPDC. It's just that it's really what you make out of it. Don't expect anyone to spoon-feed you when it comes to this. Dubai is host to a lot of great events, make good use of it.   \n\n\nWhat do I mean by \"what you make out of it\" -- all of this is two sided. You don't even have to depend on campus placements if you have family working in this industry/if you used good time networking across 4 years. Fests and Campus life are definitely relatively smaller compared to India - but honestly this is subjective if you're day scholar you'll have plenty of other ways to entertain yourself. Masters options are great and you take good use of scholarships considering academics are pretty chill here.   \n\n\nPS : I remember being here 2 years ago writing about all the reasons not to join BPDC, looking back it - I'd say there's obviously two sides to it. I'll link my previous answers to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BITSPilani/comments/ugqwa5/comment/i9ody5p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

If research is something you want to do, research interns via programs like MITACS and DAAD will become easier to obtain as they usually require stellar grades, particularly DAAD.\n\nIt will be easier for you to get a better PS for both PS-1 and PS-2. In placements, if two candidates are of equal caliber almost, there might be a shortlist benefiting you because of your high CGPA. Also, a good CGPA generally means a better understanding of the course content which is beneficial as well.",
