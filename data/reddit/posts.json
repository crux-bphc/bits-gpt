        "title": "Personal freedom in BITS and other Indian universities",
        "text": "After experiencing college life for half a year, I have a few thoughts about freedom in BITS\n\nMost of us can agree that BITS is a leader in India in terms of academic freedom. We get to make our own time tables and we have no centralized attendance policy. But on the other hand, I found BITS to be quite lacking in personal freedom. Here are some points:\n\n**-Compulsory residence:** BITS requires its students to reside on its campus. I am sure that most students would stay even if this policy is removed but I don't think there should be compulsion. Same with mess food. You can say there is lack of healthy options on campus which is why mess registration is compulsory but clearly this isn't an issue in foreign universities where students are allowed to plan their own meals. Good options are lacking *because* of compulsory mess which drastically reduces demand.\n\n**-Internet:** They say their network is for academic purposes only but hostels are for residence. They should allow us to access all websites or allow external broadbands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**-Movement:** This is a gate-pass system and outstation system (gate pass is only for hyderabad, I think). These shouldn't be there imo. Except for first year students, everyone else is an adult and should be able to move freely in and out of the campus whenever they please. I have heard that these are demanded by parents which imo is a problem of its own. I the west, many people move out at 18 and live fully independently. They even pay their own fees. I feel that India would greatly benefit if college taught us to be independent rather than just being a continuation of school where parents get to decide where we go and what we do.\n\n**-Hostels:** This is more of my personal desire but hostels should have more facilities. Many electrical appliances like heaters and coolers are not allowed (because the power supply can't handle them or something). I wish that hostel rooms could be well furnished with fridges ,etc. and be more like apartments but I get why this is not plausible (It would be extremely expensive to provide)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is your opinion about these points? Many Indian universities have similar policies and imo it would take a change in Indian culture for these policies to change.",

BITS' mess is still better than most in India, and if they do improve it to match the US' level, prices will have to increase. It will be upto the SU and SSMS student bodies to check if majority will be okay with paying more than \u20b9400 per meal for a buffet. Food wastage would be another issue. Plus, students don't really plan their own meals here unless they live off campus. It's the same weekly menu system.\n\n- Mobility in US universities is open because there's no campus system as such for most unis. Even those that do have a campus of their own don't have boundaries, and that increases crime rates so much. You'd be surprised at how many thefts, robberies, and other crimes happen around academic and residential buildings in the US. The system in India is meant for our own safety and protection.\n\nRest of your points are valid.",

So, students need to put strong effort to make any changes.\n\nRegarding, outstation access/ hostel stay, I disagree a bit. Even if you are legally adult, I hardly think most of the 3/4 yearites are capable enough to take care of themselves in the outside. In Pilani, you can't do much and only in Goa or Hyderabad, outside stay may seem good. But at what cost? Will it help you focus more on acads/extra curricular activities? \n\nThe 0 attendance rule is a boon for all but will feel like a curse to some who are used to disciplinary methods in their school/coaching. Most of us had flunked so many classes just for sake of it and had paid the price with our CGPA. Plus staying at campus helps you build bonding with your batchmates which will help you in adult life. I don't think a day scholar system can hold a candle to that aspect.",

        "text": "I am a first year in hyderabad\n\nAUGSD has introduced exit tests for our batch. Missing even 1 class means possibly losing a grade. I don't know if I have any mental issue like ADHD (My parents wont let me test because being diagnosed with mental illness is a matter of shame in society) but I find any live lecture difficult to remember. Self study is the only way for me. From 11th class I have been attending offline coaching, learning absolutely nothing, and then relearning everything at home through youtube. I thought atleast after joining BITS I won't be forced to go to lectures. Unfortunately exit tests were introduced to the very campus I chose. In sem 1, I haven't spoken to any person other than my roommate, I made no friends, joined no clubs. I spent the mornings attending classes and evening studying from youtube/books.  \n\n\nLosing grades gives me severe anxiety. I wakeup many times in the middle of night thinking about losing marks. I have had panic attacks about marks many times. I went to classes even though I was very sick (because exit tests are surprise tests in some courses). My mental health has been completely destroyed. I sit in classes knowing my time is being wasted. I keep feeling that I am wasting my life away. Why am I listening to classes if I have to relearn everything anyway? If I don't get high CG I wont get placed. My life will get ruined. These are the thoughts in my head.  I still have to suffer for 3 years.  What do I do? My college life is getting wasted in front of my eyes and I am unable to do anything.",

I think that it usually requires a large amount of cold mailing.  \n\n\n2) Most people I know only had course projects/assignments on their resume (OOP/DBS/DSA, and a very small minority had done computer graphics). Academic projects are differentiated and better than course projects IMO. An internship, academic or not, has greater value than just projects though.  \n\n\n3) NUS is the most common institute for off campus thesis from what I have seen. If you do an SI, you would probably have to go for a 5-1 thesis without any choice, since SI clashes with 5-1 PS. Also, the situation might improve by your time, but currently, getting an approval for off campus thesis from the CSIS HoD is very difficult.",

                "text": "I think I'm qualified to answer this considering I was against BPDC for the longest time, I'm a 2nd Year CS student and a student council member. Not a simple answer. And as cliched as it sounds it's what you make of it. I don't know what your expectations are but I'll try to address as many points as I can.   \n\n\n1. Placements / PS Stations : Avg CS Placement at 5-6K AED per month, but the overall placement or PS Station is pretty mediocre unless you have a 9+ CGPA. Above 9 you have great companies like Emirates, Reckitt, MSD, Siemens, PWC etc. \n2. Fests and Campus Life : I'll be realistic here, campus is 14 acres. We are a small campus both in terms of size of campus and number of people. We have a total of 1.2K Students across 4 years. That's probably how much the Indian Campus intakes per year. So the number of fests and fests themselves are proportionally less \"cooler\". \n3. Hostel/Day Scholar : Hostel is single occupancy and that's probably the biggest perk. Mess food is mediocre at the moment. Day Scholar's have transport to and from uni. The life of a day scholar is more or less like school, you're on campus at 7:30AM and leave at 3:40PM. Campus is 25 mins away from the main city, via public transport 40mins-60mins - this is a con. I wouldn't really recommend BPDC if you're not already a resident in UAE. Please read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/13iy26f/comment/jralkab/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). \n4. Masters Options and Academics + Scholarships : It's fairly easy to get a good CG since it's a mostly mediocre batch when it comes to academics (mediocre academically because the barrier to entry is pretty non existent at BPDC). This will help for both your first job as well as masters application. A BITS Pilani Degree with 9+ CG is definitely a good look for masters. Scholarships are pretty rewarding here, 10% for 8+, 15% for 8.5+ and 25% for 9+ CGPA. \n5. International Exposure : It's not necessarily false advertisement by BPDC. It's just that it's really what you make out of it. Don't expect anyone to spoon-feed you when it comes to this. Dubai is host to a lot of great events, make good use of it.   \n\n\nWhat do I mean by \"what you make out of it\" -- all of this is two sided. You don't even have to depend on campus placements if you have family working in this industry/if you used good time networking across 4 years. Fests and Campus life are definitely relatively smaller compared to India - but honestly this is subjective if you're day scholar you'll have plenty of other ways to entertain yourself. Masters options are great and you take good use of scholarships considering academics are pretty chill here.   \n\n\nPS : I remember being here 2 years ago writing about all the reasons not to join BPDC, looking back it - I'd say there's obviously two sides to it. I'll link my previous answers to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BITSPilani/comments/ugqwa5/comment/i9ody5p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

I don\u2019t think as such it shouldn\u2019t matter too much if you don\u2019t have an official minor degree, given you have done the courses separately, but I am not really sure. Very tricky. Like no one properly understands the PS algorithm and how much weight is given to each parameter for each role and each company. I have friends who did not complete the minor per say but are in JPMC and I have friends who had amazing offshoots but did not get. So very tricky and unpredictable.\n\n2. For course planning this is what I did and would suggest:\nFoFA in 3-2\nDRM, SAPM, FinMan in Summer Term\nBAAV in 4-1\n\nIt\u2019s best to do BAAV last because it requires some concepts of SAPM and FinMan (also FuFA). Moreover you need to complete your courses before 4-1 for it to count for 5-1 PS.\n\nEdit: Haven\u2019t done FRAM but i would suggest you to do it at the end only, with BAAV.",

Join a company in india which has usa offices and then ask for internal transfer and hope that it will happen fast as you are an usa citizen\n3.

I am not very clear on the details of how I am going to build it yet.i have a general sense of where I want to go with it. An interest in doing some research on this and implementing and building cool algorithms is what I think, is required. If any one wants in on this coding adventure, DM. \n\nPS: I am looking to improve my coding skills and overall having a fun time so the best coding skills aren't really the most needed thing.

But I realized a few things along the way- one of them is to stop looking for deep connections. People who seem to have many friends don't necessarily have genuine friendships and vice versa. The thing is I learned to very much like this feeling of loneliness, and now that has become a great perk to have. I don't avoid social connections altogether but even if I am feeling lonely, I can live with it happily. I was able to find satisfaction in pursuing skills that I love. I would suggest the same to you. When destiny wants, some genuine friendship will emerge on its own (and believe me it will come when you are not looking for it). You don't need to push for it. Till then, try to learn to live with this feeling (like embrace it). Because in future, that will give you way more security, than you can imagine now. Also don't ignore cgpa hustle.

You could also take up a minor in data science and go for finance and quant roles.\nOther msc degrees don't open up many opportunities, especially if they're done from BITS. Msc eco is the only exception according to me. It opens up finance placements for you.\n\nIf you really want to do msc in some other branch other than eco and go into research, I'd suggest you to rather look for other colleges that provide bsc+msc. Again, only msc eco as a single degree makes sense through BITS.",

An NC essentially deletes the course from any cg calculations, so for example if there's 20 credits in a sem and you get an NC in a 3 credit course, the denominator in your cg calculation changes to 17 (can be better or worse than an E depending on the semester, existing cg, etc but an E is almost always worse). For dual students however, they count the NC as an E grade (2 credit points) in the first year such that the denominator for all students remains the same for allotting duals. (basically if you get an NC in the first year as a dualite you're screwed). \n\nWhen you repeat the NC course, the new grade will have a star alongside it on your transcript that showcases the fact that you needed a second attempt to obtain the grade. \n\nOf course, in case you have a course or are choosing an elective for which a prerequisite is required in which you have an NC, you would have to repeat the prerec course before you are allowed to register for the original course. (the original and repeated course cannot be done in the same semester, you must repeat the prerec first then go for the original course later.)\n\nThis is all for Pilani campus btw, for other campuses it might be different",

I was a dualite (double PS) who did my evaluation post graduation. Hope somebody can benefit from it.\n\n* **Cost**: WES charges around 170 dollars (As of writing this post) for a course by course evaluation, along with additional charges (11-32 dollars per uni) to send your evaluation to the requested uni\n* **Process for Evaluation:** I was from Goa Campus and Goa has the facility to send transcripts electronically, Im not sure how it works in the other campuses\n\n1. Make a WES account and get a reference number\n2. In the duplicate transcripts form on the AUGSD site, you can fill out WES details along with your reference number. The duplicate transcript costed me Rs 500. You can mail AUGSD if you wish to confirm.\n3. Evaluation takes about a 15-30 days (longer if there's a holiday season) and universities may take more time to acknowledge they've received the result.\n\n* **Process of Evaluation:** These are certain observations I made from my evaluation.\n\n1. A- , B- and C- are converted to A, B and C respectively. D is converted to C. (idk about E).\n2. A, B and C remain as A, B and C.  For calculating WES GPA A=4, B=3, C=2.\n3. Many courses will have their weightage reduced for calculating your final gpa.  \n\\-&gt; 2 credit courses are converted to 1 credit  \n\\-&gt; 4 and 5 credit courses are converted to 3 credits.  \n\\-&gt; 20 credit courses are converted to 6 credits. (Unfortunately I dont know how 16 credit thesis is converted but I'm assuming it'll be 5 or 6 credits)\n4. 1 and 3 credit courses will have the same weightage.\"Good\" in EVS was converted to a \"B\" for me.\"CLR\" was converted to \"Pass\".\n\nAn example of how evaluation was done\n\n|Course|Credits (BITS)|Grade (BITS)|Credits (WES)|Grade (WES)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Electrical Machines|4|C-|3|C|\n|EG|2|C|1|C|\n|PS 1|5|A|3|A|\n|CALCI|3|A-|3|A|\n|PS 2|20|A|6|A|\n\nWES GPA = \\[(3\\*2) + (1\\*2) + (3\\*4) + (3\\*4) + (6\\*4)\\] / 16= 56/16 = 3.5 (on a scale of 4)\n\nNote: This is only for the BITS method of grading and may not hold true for other colleges\n\nMy approx 7.5/10 got converted to a 2.7/4 which is pretty bad on a US scale and also very different from other GPA calculators like Scholaro or UCI's calculator (Scholaro gave me a 3.1-3.2). Ofc if you have a higher GPA you will probably get a better WES GPA as well.I'd still recommend most BITS applicants to just enter their GPA out of 10 and not go for WES evaluation unless a majority of your shortlisted unis require it. The one time cost of evaluation is pretty high too and you'll already be spending quite a lot on application fee and sending your test scores.",

There is a clause regarding the required subjects for IB:  **Students need to have 3 subjects at HL (Physics, Mathematics, and one of Chemistry/Biology/Biotechnology/any other technical vocational subject) and 3 subjects at SL is made eligible for Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Science Integrated programmes.** My third 'technical vocational' subject is at an SL level not HL.

This is probably on you cause you simply didn't do enough research before joining.\n\n**I'd say use the rest of your first year to figure out what domain you have an interest in: finance, consulting, entrepreneurship, ML-AI, IT or maybe even Chemical core**. Study hard parallelly, and then maybe you won't be as confused.\n\nCompanies coming to BITS do give you a fair bit of freedom to sit for other domains during PS-2 and Placements so saying no scope and low placements is genuinely your skill issue if you don't care about acads and building your profile.",

Probably due to the market situation, I didn't get an offer in the industry of my choice, and took the first non-tech offer I got. \n\n\nWhile I'm glad to get placed, I'm also a bit lost. I know little about how the career trajectory looks like for a non tech career, and additionally as the title probably implies, I have a 7.X CG (below 7.5, won't go above it after the sem ends). Additionally, I'm in a circuit (EEE dept) branch.\n\n\nA science masters is also pretty much a no go for me, as I've gradually lost much of the interest I had in studying science subjects, even those from CnI minor (like OOP, OS, etc.) For each of these courses, I had some or the other major complaint which made me tell myself \"never again.\" \n\n\nSo I just wanted to learn experiences of other BITSians around the same CG as me.

Couldn't get a PPO because my team was on a hiring freeze.\n\nI was prepping for off- campus roles in parallel with PS2. \nGot interview calls from 10 companies over 4 months and got rejected by all before finally getting an offer from a super app in South East Asia for 25 LPA.\n\nWorked there for one year before bring impacted in a layoff.\n\nCurrently on a break and looking to  get better at DSA and development. Not looking for a role immediately but have been contacted by Google, Amazon and Confluent for interviews.

I work in non-core now but ive started with good core work ex. 7 cg wise is a good threshold number to get a foot in the door anywhere you aspire to be. Its not amazing that people presume you never did anything apart from acads, its not bad to believe you cannot pull through and learn stuff. It becomes more of an indicator that there is performance, just that its focus/effort based at times. \nOnce you start having work experience, the importance of cgpa decreases drastically. Its the real world skills that you acquire that help move further. \n\nHit me up with any specific questions you have, id be happy to answer / guide further. \n\nRemember, its a lifelong thing and this was just a part of it.

There are some batchmates working with me, who are great people. They take genuine interest in work, unlike me, and so, are good at it. I can't imagine to keep on doing this, though. \nI'm studying some maths in spare time, leftovers from my final sem thesis (which I did not complete as well), and feel like I'm halfway decent at it.
