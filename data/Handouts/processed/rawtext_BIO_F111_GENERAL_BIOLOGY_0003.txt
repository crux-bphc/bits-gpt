*Question will be asked at the end of the lecture (from that lecture itself). Student who did not attend lecture will not be eligible for giving the response, and will not get marks.

Questions for evaluation: Objective and descriptive questions won’t be limited to the textbook but from the content taught (e.g. Class notes).

Chamber Consultation Hour: To be announced by the respective lecture/tutorial section instructor.

Grading Policy: Award of grades will be guided in general by the histogram of marks. Decision on border line cases will be taken based on individual’s sincerity, student’s regularity in attending classes, and the section instructor’s assessment of the student. If a student is completely absent for any one of the components (listed in the Evaluation Scheme above), his/her performance in the course may be reported as ‘NC’ (Not Cleared).

Make-up Policy: No make-up would be considered for Quizzes under any circumstances. Make-up for other evaluation components may be given only in genuine (medical emergency) cases of absence and only after consulting the team of faculty members in the course. The campus doctor’s opinion is crucial in this process. If the absence is anticipated, before the examination, prior permission of the Instructor-in-charge is necessary. Request for make-up should reach the Instructor-in-charge at the earliest. Also, refer to Clause 4.07 of BITS Academic Regulations for more details.

Notices: All notices/ announcements regarding this course shall be displayed in Course Management System (CMS).

Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy: Academic honesty and integrity are to be maintained by all the students throughout the semester and no type of academic dishonesty is acceptable.
