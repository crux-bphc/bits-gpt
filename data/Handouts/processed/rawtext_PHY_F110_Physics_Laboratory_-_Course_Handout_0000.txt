1. Aims and Learning Outcomes:

Familiarize the students to the experimental methods in physics and also to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical experience. Students will learn operation of scientific equipment for collecting data from the online videos and do the analysis of collected data.

Learning outcomes:

Identifying and quantifying sources of error in an experiment. Fitting experimental data to an expected theoretical expression. Error analysis. Use of logarithmic graph sheets. Usage of optical instruments such as microscopes and spectrometers, through online

videos.
