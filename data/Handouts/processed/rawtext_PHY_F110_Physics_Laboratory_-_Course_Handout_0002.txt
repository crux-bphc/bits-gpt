The total marks for day-to-day performance of the labs will be scaled down to the corresponding total marks mentioned in the first row of the previous table.

Students MUST submit the lab report in the specified format for each experiment within 72 hours of the class. Late submission will not be counted as SUBMISSION and therefore no marks would be awarded. Students are expected to read the allotted experiments from the manuals before attending the lab, so that they can actively take part in the discussion and answer the quiz.

5. MAKE-UP: The schedule of the experiment is very strict: the students are expected to attend all the labs regularly. Make-up will be given only in case of hospitalization/other unavoidable technical issues. More than 2 make-up experiments will not be entertained.

6. NOTICE: Notices concerning this course will be displayed on CMS and the google classroom. 7.Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy: Academic honesty and integrity are to be maintained by all the students throughout the semester and no type of academic dishonesty is acceptable.
