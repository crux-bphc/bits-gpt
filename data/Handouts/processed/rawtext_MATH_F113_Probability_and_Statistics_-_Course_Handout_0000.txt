1. Scope and objective of the course:

Probability theory deals with many real-life problems, which either inherently involve the chance phenomena or describing the behaviour of the system explicitly with statistical properties. Interpretation of the system behaviour in many engineering and sciences depends on concept of probability and statistics that familiarize with the computational and analytical aspects. The course deals with the basic properties of various distributions and other related things.
