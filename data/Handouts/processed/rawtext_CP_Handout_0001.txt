Scope and Objectives of the Course: This is an introductory course to computers and programming. The language used to explain the concepts is preferably C. This course uses a bottom-up approach to teach the beginners what is the structure of a computer and how it can be programmed. It also covers adequate knowledge of Number systems. The course starts with the process of creating or developing algorithms/ flowcharts for solving different types of problems using a Computer. At a later stage, it covers programming constructs used in most languages like C, C++, etc. including data types, variables, operators, input/output, decision making, loops, arrays, functions, structures, dynamic memory allocations, file handling. Students also get hands on experience C programs in the laboratory.

The primary objectives of the course are to introduce:

Basic representation of data and how to process this data using different types of storage representations inside a computer.

Algorithm development for different tasks to be executed on a Computer and programming these using the high-level languages.
