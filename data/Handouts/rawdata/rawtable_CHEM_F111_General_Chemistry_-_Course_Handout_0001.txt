Rotation around sigma bonds, conformational analysis of butane, cyclohexane, and substituted cyclohexanes. Calculate the change in free energy for a chemical change from tabulated thermodynamic data; predict the spontaneity of a reaction, determine how temperature effects spontaneity of physical & chemical change based on H and S. Relate and apply concept of chemical equilibrium and response of chemical equilibria to temperature and pressure. Define the rate and order of reactions, write the general form of the rate law, practical determination of order and rate constants from the available concentration values of reactants/products as a function of time. Usage of "methods of initial rates", "isolation method", half- life" concepts. Effect of temperature on the rates of reaction. Using steady state approximation to derive rate law theoretically for a possible mechanism. Relating the interaction between light and matter, apply knowledge of detailed understanding of vibrational and electronic spectra of small molecules, isotope shifts, detailed understanding of electronic states of atoms, the molecules, Franck-Condon principle; predict possible vibrational electronic transitions frequencies and Understand the basic principles and techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; apply the knowledge gained identification of organic molecules. Classify structural and constitutional isomers, explain the terms torsional energy, torsional strain, angle strain.
