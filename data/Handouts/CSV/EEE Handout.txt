1. Course Description: 
 
The course covers various passive and active elements used in electrical networks, dependent and 
independent voltage and current sources (both DC and AC), analysis of DC and AC networks – KCL, KVL, 
network theorems, analysis and response of single order and second order circuits, polyphase circuits, 
magnetics, electromagnetic induction, transformers and basics of rotating electrical machines, basic 
electronic circuits using diodes and transistors, biasing and applications, operational amplifiers and 
introduction to digital electronics. 
 
2. Scope and objective of the Course:  
 
Understanding physics of operation of electrical and electronic ciruits with various passive and active 
elements is required for all the engineering and science professionals. This course is designed to given the 
students of all engineering and science streams to give a primary exposure to basic electrical engineering. 
This is quite important for the students which will be useful for their career growth.
