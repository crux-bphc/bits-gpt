Tutorials: The tutorial hour will be used for quick review of the material covered in the lectures, clarification of doubts, and problem solving. 
# Two announced tests will be conducted in the tutorial hour. Make up is not permissible for this evaluation component.  
 
**This evaluation is based on the classroom interaction of the students with the instructor in respective tutorial section only. For the evaluation 
under this component, it is solely student’s responsibility to attend his/her registered tutorial section only. Biometric attendance in tandem 
with the physical attendance, collected by the instructor shall be taken into account for marks and grading. Therefore, it is individual student’s 
responsibility to ensure providing the attendance via both methods.  
 
6. Chamber Consultation Hours: To be announced through a separate notice. 
 
7. Notices: Notices concerning the course will be displayed on the Chemistry Department Notice Board / CMS. 
 
8. Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy: Academic honesty and integrity are to be maintained by all the students throughout the semester and no 
type of academic dishonesty is acceptable. 
 
9. Make-up-policy: Make up would be considered by the Instructor in charge & the team only for very genuine reasons, with valid documents.
