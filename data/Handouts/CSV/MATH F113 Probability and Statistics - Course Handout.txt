1.   Scope and objective of the course: 
Probability theory deals with many real-life problems, which either inherently involve the chance phenomena or 
describing the behaviour of the system explicitly with statistical properties. Interpretation of the system behaviour 
in many engineering and sciences depends on concept of probability and statistics that familiarize with the 
computational and analytical aspects. The course deals with the basic properties of various distributions and other 
related things.
