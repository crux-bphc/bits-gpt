1. Course description (as given in the Institute Bulletin): 
Engineering materials, casting, forming, machining, joining, powder metallurgy, additive manufacturing, plastic 
 processing, various other manufacturing processes and related laboratory exercises. 
2. Scope and Objective of the Course: 
This course is required for all first-degree students at first year level. The course will provide an overview of the 
techniques and applications of basic manufacturing processes used for producing finished articles from raw materials. 
The course is practice-orientated and requires that basic skills in handling of tools, machines and machine tools used 
in different manufacturing processes are acquired through the hands-on experience. The practical knowledge is 
supplemented by the lectures to provide the knowledge and genesis of various manufacturing processes. The primary 
objective of this course is to learn how the physical artifacts we use are manufactured and gain technical knowledge 
and skills. Much of the knowledge in the course is conceptual and no great mathematics is involved. This knowledge 
will be useful in whatever discipline the students are going to specialize.

5. Evaluation Scheme: 
 
6. Laboratory: 
The practical work contributes fifty percent directly and much more indirectly; therefore, it must be carried out 
seriously. The practicals are intended to provide experience in handling of basic tools, machine tools and make simple 
utility jobs. Laboratory marks mentioned includes marks for models (viva) and attendance in practicals. Details of 
practical are available in the “Laboratory Manual”. 
 
 
7. Chamber Consultation Hour: To be announced in the class. 
 
8. Notices concerning the course: All notices concerning the course will be displayed on the CMS notice board. 
 
9. Make-up Policy: Maximum 2 makeups will be permitted for the lab exercises. Makeups will be permitted for 
other evaluation components only for genuine cases. 
 
10. Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy: Academic honesty and integrity are to be maintained by all the 
students throughout the semester and no type of academic dishonesty is acceptable.
