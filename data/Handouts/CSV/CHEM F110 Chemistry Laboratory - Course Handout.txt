1. Course Description: This course is based on laboratory experiments in different fields of 
chemistry. The course is conducted for first year students.  
 
2. Scope and Objective: The main objective of this course is to educate the students with different 
aspects of experiments in chemistry. The students will carry out a set of experiments that will 
expose them to various experimental techniques like preparation of standard solution, chemical 
synthesis, filtrations, recrystallization, and operating of different scientific equipment for collecting 
data and analysis. Experiments in Organic and Inorganic chemistry will include synthesis and 
analysis of different compounds. Experiments in Physical chemistry will include pH metry, 
conductometry, spectrophotometry and chemical kinetics experiments.  
 
3. Text Book(s): Chemistry Laboratory Manual 
 
4.  Reference Book: Reference sources for each experiment will be specified as necessary.  
 
5. Course Plan: Students will perform selected experiments in Organic, Inorganic & Physical 
chemistry

*Attendance and Punctuality, Laboratory Conduct, and Record maintenance = 15 M will be 
important in the evaluation.  
** All 9 (nine) experiments will be evaluated in the lab, and the best eight will be considered. 
 
7. Make-up policy: There will be no makeup granted.  
8. Notice: All notices concerning the course will be displayed on Chemistry Department Notice Board 
and/or CMS. Lab manual, White Lab Coat with proper shoes covering the entire feet are 
compulsory. 
 
9. Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy: Academic honesty and integrity are to be maintained by all the 
students throughout the semester and no type of academic dishonesty is acceptable. 
 
10. Final grading will be done based on the overall performance of a student in each of the 
components as listed in item no. 6.
