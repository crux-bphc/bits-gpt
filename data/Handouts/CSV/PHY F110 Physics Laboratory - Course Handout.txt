1. Aims and Learning Outcomes: 
Familiarize the students to the experimental methods in physics and also to integrate 
theoretical knowledge with practical experience. Students will learn operation of scientific 
equipment for collecting data from the online videos and do the analysis of collected data. 
 
Learning outcomes: 
 Identifying and quantifying sources of error in an experiment. 
 Fitting experimental data to an expected theoretical expression. 
 Error analysis. 
 Use of logarithmic graph sheets. 
 Usage of optical instruments such as microscopes and spectrometers, through online 
videos.

The total marks for day-to-day performance of the labs will be scaled down to the 
corresponding total marks mentioned in the first row of the previous table. 
 
Students MUST submit the lab report in the specified format for each experiment within 72 
hours of the class. Late submission will not be counted as SUBMISSION and therefore no 
marks would be awarded. Students are expected to read the allotted experiments from the 
manuals before attending the lab, so that they can actively take part in the discussion and 
answer the quiz. 
 
5. MAKE-UP:  
The schedule of the experiment is very strict: the students are expected to attend all the labs 
regularly. Make-up will be given only in case of hospitalization/other unavoidable technical 
issues. More than 2 make-up experiments will not be entertained. 
 
 
6. NOTICE: Notices concerning this course will be displayed on CMS and the google 
classroom. 
7.Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy: Academic honesty and integrity are to be 
maintained by all the students throughout the semester and no type of academic dishonesty is 
acceptable.
