 
SECOND SEMESTER 2023-2024 
Course Handout Part-I 
Date: 09-01-2024 
  
In addition to part I (General handout for all courses appended to the timetable) this portion gives further details 
regarding the course.  
Course Number : PHY F111  
Course Title : MECHANICS, OSCILLATIONS & WAVES  
Instructor-in-Charge : SUBHADEEP ROY 
Instructors : P. K. Thiruvikraman, Sankar Davuluri, Rickmoy Samanta, Suvadip Das, Tanay Nag. 
 
Course Description: “Mechanics, Oscillations, and Waves” serves as a fundamental course in physics for 
science and engineering. This course, consisting of a series of lectures coupled with several demonstrations, 
provides a good, sound, working knowledge of the following topics: polar coordinates, angular momentum, 
central force motion, harmonic oscillator, coupled oscillations, waves and wave equation. 
 
Scope & Objective: Newtonian mechanics, the oldest branch of physics, is rather robust and possesses a very 
solid foundation. The phenomena of oscillations and waves have always been intriguing and are ubiquitous in 
the world around us. A course on “Mechanics, Oscillations, and Waves” is indispensable to understand other 
branches of science and engineering and serves as one of the stepping stones for scientific, engineering and 
medical research and development. The wide-ranging spectrum of subject matter of this course provides a 
foundation for advanced level physics courses. The objective of this course is to develop good physics problem-
solving skills by building a deep conceptual understanding of the subject.
