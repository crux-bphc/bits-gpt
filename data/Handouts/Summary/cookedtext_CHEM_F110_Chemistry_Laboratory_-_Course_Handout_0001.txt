Course: CHEM F110 Chemistry Laboratory
Summary:
Lab 4 of the CHEM F110 Chemistry Laboratory involves the preparation of the potassium bis(oxalate) Cu(II) complex and the preparation of iron acetyl. Detailed instructions and procedures for these experiments will be provided during the lab session, allowing students to gain practical experience in coordination chemistry and chemical synthesis. The hands-on nature of these experiments contributes to a deeper understanding of the principles learned in the theoretical aspect of the course.
